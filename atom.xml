    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Captivating-Content-Incorporate-These-20-Magic-Words"><a href="#Captivating-Content-Incorporate-These-20-Magic-Words" class="headerlink" title="Captivating Content: Incorporate These 20 Magic Words"></a>Captivating Content: Incorporate These 20 Magic Words</h2><p>If you’re not sure how to write your next marketing message, look no further. We’ve compiled a list of words and phrases that work magic in the world of advertising. You can use these words and phrases to create an effective marketing message—and increase your chances of turning first-time customers into repeat buyers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/marketing-phrase.jpg"                      alt="marketing phrase"                ></p><h2 id="1-Actionable"><a href="#1-Actionable" class="headerlink" title="1. Actionable"></a>1. Actionable</h2><p>If a word or phrase is actionable, it means that there are steps that can be taken to make it happen. For example, if you were to say “call now!”, this would not be actionable. It’s just a suggestion, or perhaps even a joke. However, if you were to say “The best way to get started with our service is by calling us at 1-800-GO-GLOVES” then this would be an actionable statement because there are specific steps involved in getting started (calling the number) and they lead directly into using the product (getting gloves).</p><h2 id="2-Free"><a href="#2-Free" class="headerlink" title="2. Free"></a>2. Free</h2><p>Free is a powerful word. Free is a word that people love to hear!</p><p>Think about it: if you’re reading this article, chances are you’ve already seen the word “free” in bold print at least once. The reason? Our brains love it so much that they don’t want us to miss anything related to free stuff!</p><p>If you’re thinking about how much more effective your marketing strategy could be if only there were some ways for people to immediately know how much value your product gives them and how quickly they can benefit from using it… well, now’s your chance!</p><h2 id="3-Limited"><a href="#3-Limited" class="headerlink" title="3. Limited"></a>3. Limited</h2><p>While it’s important to be careful not to use this word too much, you can still use it to highlight a special offer or encourage people to take action. For example: “Limited time offer.”</p><p>You may also want to consider using the phrase “Only X left!” This type of language is often used when selling products online, as it gives shoppers an idea of how many items are left and encourages them to buy quickly before they run out.</p><h2 id="4-Amazing"><a href="#4-Amazing" class="headerlink" title="4. Amazing"></a>4. Amazing</h2><p>Amazing is an adjective that can be used to describe something that is simply remarkable. The word itself conjures up feelings of awe, wonder, and surprise. If you want to convey those sentiments in your marketing, this is the word for you!</p><p>Here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li>Use it when talking about a product or service that’s so amazing it will blow away your customers’ expectations</li><li>Use it when talking about how amazed someone will be by something amazing</li><li>Use it as part of an ad headline that promises what sounds like an almost impossible feat</li></ul><h2 id="5-Bestseller"><a href="#5-Bestseller" class="headerlink" title="5. Bestseller"></a>5. Bestseller</h2><p>Bestseller. It’s the word that gets your pulse racing when you’re browsing through a bookstore, and it can make or break a book’s success. But what does “bestselling” mean?</p><p>Bestseller lists are often manipulated by publishers, who can get more favorable reviews from influential writers if they promise them higher placement on the list (or even pay for their review). And these days, there’s also serious debate about whether bestsellers truly represent what people actually want to read.</p><p>The reality is that bestsellers are subjective—their popularity depends on their category and how many copies they’ve sold in comparison to other books in that category or genre. That said, there are certain words and phrases that will make anyone sound like an authority on the subject at hand.</p><h2 id="6-Boost"><a href="#6-Boost" class="headerlink" title="6. Boost"></a>6. Boost</h2><p>Boost is a 2-word phrase that can help you make all kinds of marketing magic happen:</p><ul><li>Boost sales. Use it when you want to get people buying from your store, signing up for a webinar or other product offering, or subscribing to your newsletter.</li><li>Boost engagement. Use it when you want to get people engaging with your brand on social media and make more comments on blog posts and forum discussions.</li><li>Boost conversions—that is, the number of visitors who take action after seeing or reading something about your business (such as clicking through from an ad). Boost conversions by using this word in ads and landing pages.</li><li>Boost traffic—that is, the number of visitors coming to your site through search engines like Google or Bing; paid advertising (on Facebook or elsewhere); organic natural search results; email campaigns; etcetera!</li></ul><h2 id="7-Breakthrough"><a href="#7-Breakthrough" class="headerlink" title="7. Breakthrough"></a>7. Breakthrough</h2><ul><li>Breakthroughs are important to marketing.</li><li>Breakthroughs are important to customers.</li><li>Breakthroughs are important to the world.</li><li>Breakthroughs are important to your business.</li><li>Breakthroughs are important to your marketing and your customers too!</li></ul><h2 id="8-Complete"><a href="#8-Complete" class="headerlink" title="8. Complete"></a>8. Complete</h2><ul><li>Complete</li><li>To finish something (complete a task, to complete the work, etc.)</li><li>To do something completely (to complete your studies)</li><li>To do something in a way that is not lacking or incomplete.</li></ul><h2 id="9-Comprehensive"><a href="#9-Comprehensive" class="headerlink" title="9. Comprehensive"></a>9. Comprehensive</h2><p>A guide is a great way to help your readers understand the ins and outs of a topic, especially if you’re covering something that might have a lot of moving parts.</p><p>A review can be useful for new products or services, but it’s also helpful for existing products, like those that have recently been revamped. It helps people decide whether they want to buy the product now or wait until later when there are more reviews available.</p><p>A solution is just what it sounds like: a solution for whatever problem your audience may face with their business. If you can offer this type of solution consistently across all areas of your marketing strategy (and beyond), then you’ll build trust with your readers as an expert who understands their needs and wants to help them succeed with whatever goals they’ve set out for themselves!</p><h2 id="10-Cutting-Edge"><a href="#10-Cutting-Edge" class="headerlink" title="10. Cutting-Edge"></a>10. Cutting-Edge</h2><p>What is cutting-edge? The term “cutting edge” refers to something new and innovative. It can be used as a noun or an adjective, and it typically implies that the advertised product or service has been designed with the latest technology in mind. What does this mean for you? When you use this word in your marketing copy, it’ll show potential customers that you’re on top of what’s trending. You’ll also give them confidence that your company knows what it’s doing when it comes to providing quality products&#x2F;services at competitive prices—and maybe even provide some reassurance if they’re worried about being scammed by shady businesses!</p><p>When should I use cutting-edge?</p><p>There are many occasions when inserting “cutting-edge” into your marketing materials will benefit you enormously:</p><ul><li>When describing a product or service and its benefits (e.g., “We’ve put our clients’ needs first by developing cutting-edge solutions.”)</li><li>As part of a call-to-action (CTA) towards people who want something different—either because they want something new or because they’re bored with their current situation (e.g., “Call us today if you’re ready for a change!”).</li></ul><h2 id="11-Danger"><a href="#11-Danger" class="headerlink" title="11. Danger"></a>11. Danger</h2><p>This is a powerful word and one you can use in your marketing to describe any product, situation, or person.</p><p>Although it might sound like a simple idea at first glance, danger is actually a word that encompasses all manner of things: danger can be used to describe a product (e.g., this car is dangerous) or a situation (e.g., walking home late at night is dangerous). Danger also has an emotional charge; it evokes feelings of fear and excitement in equal measure — which makes it perfect for describing people who make us feel those emotions! You could say “dangerous” about anyone from someone who likes taking risks to the guy who works out every day at the gym. It’s not just something he does—it’s his identity!</p><h2 id="12-Effective"><a href="#12-Effective" class="headerlink" title="12. Effective"></a>12. Effective</h2><p>You can use this word to describe the results of your product or service. This is a short, sweet, and simple way to tell people what they’ll get from using your product or service. It’s also easy to understand, which makes it an effective marketing strategy. Effective is also a positive word that doesn’t include any negative connotations.</p><h2 id="13-Exclusive"><a href="#13-Exclusive" class="headerlink" title="13. Exclusive"></a>13. Exclusive</h2><p>Exclusive is a word that can be used to describe a product or service. It can also be used to appeal to your target audience, which is why it’s effective in marketing. For example, if you’re marketing a luxury car, the word “exclusive” will make people think of exclusivity and luxury. Exclusive means that something has been restricted or kept to only certain people or places; it’s something that not everyone has access to, so exclusive items are perceived as being more valuable than average ones.</p><p>It’s important for businesses trying to sell products online because using this word shows how much value they put into their products and services (and how much money they think customers will spend on them).</p><h2 id="14-Faster"><a href="#14-Faster" class="headerlink" title="14. Faster"></a>14. Faster</h2><p>Speed is a well-known concept in the marketing world. It’s often associated with companies that move quickly, and it’s often used to describe how quickly a product or service can be produced.</p><p>However, we need to take a step back and ask ourselves what speed really means. Speed isn’t just about moving fast; it’s also about making decisions rapidly, processing work quickly and efficiently, getting results fast, and implementing changes swiftly and creatively—in fact, it could be said that speed is one of the most important assets in business today.</p><h2 id="15-Fantastic"><a href="#15-Fantastic" class="headerlink" title="15. Fantastic"></a>15. Fantastic</h2><p>Fantastic is a strong word. It should be used sparingly because it can make your customers feel like they are being compared to people who don’t have such fabulous products or services.</p><p>Fantastic work best when describing products or services that really are fantastic, so don’t use it lightly!</p><h2 id="16-Free-Trial-Period"><a href="#16-Free-Trial-Period" class="headerlink" title="16. Free Trial Period"></a>16. Free Trial Period</h2><p>A free trial period is a valuable tool for your business. It gives you the opportunity to show off your product or service and help customers get a feel for how they’ll benefit from using it. The best part? You don’t have to spend any money because people are willing to try something new without paying anything upfront.</p><p>This strategy works well when you offer a risk-free opportunity for customers who might not be ready yet to buy your product or service right away but still want some time with it before committing themselves financially. People will often look at prices first, so if there are no costs associated with trying out the service before making a purchase decision, this may encourage them to take advantage of offering their free trial periods as well!</p><h2 id="17-Guaranteed-Results"><a href="#17-Guaranteed-Results" class="headerlink" title="17. Guaranteed Results"></a>17. Guaranteed Results</h2><p>Guaranteed results are powerful because they solve a problem for your customers and give them confidence in their decision to purchase. The guarantee should be specific, such as “100% Satisfaction Guarantee,” “Money Back Guarantee,” or “60-Day Money Back Guarantee.”</p><p>Your guarantee should be easy to understand and use. It’s also important that it includes the steps required to receive a refund or exchange if you don’t like what you’ve purchased. If this doesn’t make sense, ask yourself how your customers will feel when trying to take advantage of their guarantee. If there is any ambiguity or confusion about how to take advantage of their guarantee, then it needs revision or removal altogether.  </p><h2 id="18-How-To-Guide"><a href="#18-How-To-Guide" class="headerlink" title="18. How-To Guide"></a>18. How-To Guide</h2><p>How-to guides have been around as long as there have been things to learn. They’re also a great way to keep people coming back to your site because you can use them to help customers solve problems and answer questions.</p><p>When it comes down to it, how-to guides are extremely popular because they’re so easy for users to digest—and even easier for marketers and content creators like you! Let’s say you want to create a guide about how to make the perfect cup of coffee; all you need is some good research skills and some writing chops (or at least access to someone who has both).</p><p>How-to guides are also great for SEO purposes: when people search for relevant keywords or topics on Google or another search engine, they’ll likely be looking for solutions or answers that align with their needs—which means there’s an opportunity there for brands willing and ready enough.</p><h2 id="19-Increased-Revenue"><a href="#19-Increased-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="19. Increased Revenue"></a>19. Increased Revenue</h2><p>You can use the increased revenue to describe the benefits of your product or service. For example, if you’re selling a weight loss program, and your clients are losing 2 pounds per week, that’s a 20% increase in their weight loss over what they were doing before.</p><ul><li>Measure how much money you make on each sale. If it’s just $20 bucks per sale, then that means there’s room for growth! You’ve got some increasing to do!</li><li>Use terms like “increased revenue” or “revenue” when talking about sales numbers and other financial metrics at work. Your boss will be impressed by your ability - as long as he doesn’t know what those words mean!</li></ul><h2 id="20-Incredible"><a href="#20-Incredible" class="headerlink" title="20. Incredible"></a>20. Incredible</h2><p>This word is perfect to describe something that’s so hard to believe it’s almost unbelievable. You know, like when your mom asks you if you need money and you respond with “Incredibly!” Or when someone says they want to go on vacation with you, but they don’t know where or when yet. Incredibly!</p><p>You can also use it to describe something amazing. For example: “That was an incredible performance!”</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you have the best marketing words and phrases in your vocabulary, it’s time to use them! They are easy to integrate into your content as long as you keep them simple and don’t overdo it. The key is not just using these words once or twice but rather consistently throughout an entire blog post or piece of writing so that readers can really see how well they fit together with each other in a “Professional”, and “Friendly” tone.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square

There are different video shooting modes available. You can choose from super slow-motion, timelapse, and even hyper-lapse. Timelapse is capturing a fixed frame multiple times at regular intervals. Thereafter, the captured frames are compiled in a short video form. The frame rate is set low and the phone camera stays fixed at its position.</p><p>On the other hand, a hyper-lapse is a timelapse where the camera moves. You must have come across videos where timelapse plays for a few seconds. You must have noticed how the timelapse transforms the entire video content immensely. You can accomplish the same with your Samsung time lapse and hyper-lapse feature. We will illustrate how to create timelapse video on Samsung mobile devices.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Timelapse-Video-on-Samsung"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Timelapse-Video-on-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung"></a>Part 1. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung</h2><p>Suppose you want to shoot a video of the sunrise or sunset. If you shoot in the regular video mode, the video length will be long. When you play the video, the changes in the movement of the sun will be super slow. That is where timelapse can do wonders. You can shoot a long video by taking photos of the scene at regular intervals.</p><p>When you play the photos in video form, it becomes a very short timelapse video. You can show an hour-long sunrise in a few minutes or seconds. You can create such a timelapse video with your Samsung phone. Here are the steps on how to do time lapse on Samsung mobile device.</p><p>Step1 Open the Camera app on your Samsung device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/open-samsung-camera-app.jpg"                      alt="open samsung camera app"                ></p><p>Step2 When the Camera app opens, go to the bottom of the app screen.

Thereafter, tap on the Shutter button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-time-lapse-video-samsung.jpg"                      alt="shoot time lapse video samsung"                ></p><p>Step5 You will see a red bar stating the hyper-lapse video duration and the normal video duration. When you want to end shooting the timelapse, tap on the Stop or Shutter button again.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Related-FAQs-about-Timelapse-on-Samsung"><a href="#Part-2-Related-FAQs-about-Timelapse-on-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Finding-Balance-The-Art-of-Choosing-Video-Dimensions"><a href="#Finding-Balance-The-Art-of-Choosing-Video-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="Finding Balance: The Art of Choosing Video Dimensions"></a>Finding Balance: The Art of Choosing Video Dimensions</h2><p>Video aspect ratios are changing depending on which platform you are using. Knowing the characteristics about aspect ratios is crucial to accomplish the ideal visual appeal across any platform.</p><p>If you want to learn more about video aspect ratios, how to apply them to different social media platforms, then you are in the right place! This article will explain what a video aspect ratio is, it includes common video aspect ratios you see nowadays, and includes recommended aspect ratios for video on various social media platforms.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right into it!</p><h2 id="1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a video aspect ratio?"></a>1. What is a video aspect ratio?</h2><p>Aspect ratio is a digital image projection attribute describing the distance between the width and the height of an image. The dimensions are also defined as shapes such as a square which is 4:3. A rectangle represents the 16:9 standard high definition aspect ratio, and inverted what you see on phones, that will be 9:16. 9 refers to the width and 16 to the height.</p><h2 id="2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios"><a href="#2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios" class="headerlink" title="2. Commonly used aspect ratios"></a>2. Commonly used aspect ratios</h2><p>There is no same aspect ratio that is used across all social media platforms. Depending on which social media platform you are planning to upload, you have to make sure you have the correct aspect ratio for your target audience. The optimal viewing experience is what matters.</p><h3 id="16-9-Widescreen"><a href="#16-9-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="16:9 Widescreen"></a>16:9 Widescreen</h3><p>This aspect ratio is recognized as the worldwide reference format for film, mobile devides, DSLR cameras, streaming platforms, social media platforms, and many more. It is known as landscape viewing which include 720p, 1080p HD and 4K resolution.</p><h3 id="4-3-Standard"><a href="#4-3-Standard" class="headerlink" title="4:3 Standard"></a>4:3 Standard</h3><p>This resolution is originally used in older television screens, which transformed into mobile use as this aspect ratio works really well for Instagram and Facebook videos, referring to the 9:16 phone resolution making a square video more pleasant to watch and to be featured in in-feed videos.</p><h3 id="9-16-Vertical"><a href="#9-16-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="9:16 Vertical"></a>9:16 Vertical</h3><p>The 9:16 aspect ratio has become the mainstream resolution for smartphones for easier viewing of videos. This resolution allows for the vertical display of videos on tablets and phones, meaning that it allows videos to play while the device is being held in its upright position. This works ideally for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts, and more.</p><h3 id="21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen"><a href="#21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="21:9 Cinematic Widescreen"></a>21:9 Cinematic Widescreen</h3><p>The 21:9 resolution is designed for filming ultra-wide screen movies that gives the viewer a theater-like feeling. It’s mostly used to display films and movies in anamorphic formats. Just like on ultra-wide monitors, it allows the video to be shown across the entire screen, giving you a cinema-like experience. This resolution contributes to a broader viewing experience in any shape or form.</p><h2 id="3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose"><a href="#3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose" class="headerlink" title="3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?"></a>3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?</h2><p>Depending on your project, broadcast location and filming options, here you can find an overview of which platforms are using which resolutions and how you can use that to improve your filming and viewer experience.</p><h3 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h3><p>Facebook is one of the most used website across the world on both computer and the mobile app. This is a great platform to let people discover your content. In order to please new viewers, let’s look at the resolutions Facebook supports and which one would be your best option depending on your content.</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Facebook feed videos</p><p>16:9 for in-stream ads on Facebook</p><p>9:16 for Facebook live videos</p><p>9:16 for Facebook stories</p><h3 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h3><p>To this day, it’s safe to say that YouTube is the leading platform in the video industry. Not only because of how long they have been around, but also about how much content is uploaded every minute and how many users it has each month. To give the viewers the best experience, here are the top aspect ratios we recommend when posting content onto your YouTube channel.</p><p>16:9 for YouTube live streams</p><p>9:16 for YouTube Shorts</p><p>16:9 for regular HD videos</p><p>21:9 for cinematic videos&#x2F;shortfilms</p><h3 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h3><p>When talking about Instagram, which is very similar to Facebook, use these aspect ratios to ensure that your quality will be the best of the best.</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Reels</p><p>4:3 for Instagram feed advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Story advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Stories</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Instagram feed videos</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Live streams</p><p>9:16 for IGTV</p><h3 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h3><p>Before Musical.ly users were migrated to a new platform called TikTok in 2018, it has been the leader on the board for a long time, and here are the recommended resolutions we think give the best results. Tik Tok allows you to share short videos, and is used by young people as an outlet to show their talents whether it’s dancing, singing, cooking, comedy or any other form of entertainment they can express and use on the platform. There’s also a feature to work together and collaborate with other Tik Tok creators across the globe.</p><p>16:9 for organic Tik Tok feed videos</p><p>16:9 for Tik Tok live videos</p><p>1:1; 16:9 or 9:16 for TikTok advertisements</p><h2 id="4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video"><a href="#4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video" class="headerlink" title="4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?"></a>4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?</h2><p>A very important point we’d like to mention is that we don’t recommend changing the aspect ratio after filming, because it could harm the video quality and we think it’s best to choose the aspect ratio on your phone or camera before filming, besides that we have some great tips for optimizing your video for the watching experience below.</p><h3 id="Black-bars"><a href="#Black-bars" class="headerlink" title="Black bars"></a>Black bars</h3><p>When editing your video, adding black bars is not changing the aspect ratio as you are just adding black bars to the screen. What we do recommend is cropping the video until you get the desired result. Adding black bars won’t automatically make the platform adjust the video and it will affect the viewer experience.</p><h3 id="Cropping"><a href="#Cropping" class="headerlink" title="Cropping"></a>Cropping</h3><p>Cropping your video will allow you to remove a section from your video, which works perfect for unwanted objects or people. While cropping the video, you are forced to pick the essential part of your video and disregard the rest of the video and to remove distraction from the frame.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Having your video tested on multiple devices will allow you to see a preview of what the viewer will see and make necessary changes if needed. When your video looks perfect, you can be sure that it will give a seamless experience across all platforms, without the fear of losing video quality.</p><p><a class="link"

It is a video-sharing platform where people share videos doing different activities. Due to the rise of cyberbullying, racism, and other harmful activities, concerns have been raised for minors using TikTok. In a bid to counter it, TikTok has banned kids under 13 from using the app.</p><p>The accounts of teens from 13 to 16 have been made private to minimize the negative effects. If you, by mistake, have entered the wrong birthdate when setting up your account, you can learn <strong>how to change your age on TikTok</strong> from this article.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="change age on tiktok featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Age-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Age-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok"></a>Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok</h2><p>The 13-year age restriction on TikTok is not only to protect minors from the harmful side of the internet. It is to comply with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States. To ensure that users don’t cheat with age-requirement, TikTok has removed the option to edit the birthdate from the app.</p><p>It has also made all the accounts of those under 16 privates. If your account has been age-restricted by mistake, below are two possible methods on <strong>how</strong> <strong>to edit age on TikTok</strong>.</p><h3 id="Way-1-Contact-TikTok-Support-Team-to-Change-Your-Age-Recommended"><a href="#Way-1-Contact-TikTok-Support-Team-to-Change-Your-Age-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)"></a>Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)</h3><p>Since TikTok has removed the feature to edit your birthdate from its app, you will need to contact their support team to change your age. You can contact support through the app if your account is still working. Otherwise, you will need to contact them through email. Below are the steps to contact support for changing your age through the TikTok app on your smartphone:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your TikTok app and tap on “Profile” from the bottom right corner. Next, touch on “Three Lines” from the top right corner of the profile screen and access “Settings and Privacy.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="select settings and privacy"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now navigate to the “Support &amp; About” section and tap “Report a Problem.” Press “Account and Profile” on the next screen and tap “Editing Profile.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="select report a problem option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Here, choose “Other,” and on the next window, press “Need More Help?” It will open a feedback form where you can mention your problem and request the support team to solve it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on need more help"                ></p><h3 id="Way-2-Create-a-New-TikTok-Account-to-Change-Your-Age-Not-Recommended"><a href="#Way-2-Create-a-New-TikTok-Account-to-Change-Your-Age-Not-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)"></a>Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)</h3><p>If your TikTok account has been placed under age restriction, you can create a new TikTok account with the correct age. However, it is not the recommended method, as you will lose all of your old account data and followers.</p><p>If you are underage, you should not try to create a new account with a false age. Lying about your age can result in legal difficulties for you if caught. You can create a new TikTok account on your smartphone using TikTok app through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install the TikTok app through Google Play Store or App Store and open it. Agree to their terms and services and tap “Profile” from the bottom right corner to navigate to the signup page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-5.jpg"                      alt="access the profile tab"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you choose “Email or Phone,” you will need to provide your “Email” or “Phone” on the next screen. You will need to go through a verification CAPTCHA and, on the next screen, create a password for your account. Provide your correct birthdate and press “Next” to complete the account creation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-6.jpg"                      alt="confirm your birthdate"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can also use your Google, Facebook, Apple, or Twitter account to create your TikTok account. Pressing any of these will take you to the respective app for login verification. Provide the confirmation, and your TikTok account will be created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-7.jpg"                      alt="select social media to sign up"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-TikTok-Video-Editor-–-Filmora-for-Mobile"><a href="#Part-2-TikTok-Video-Editor-–-Filmora-for-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: TikTok Video Editor – Filmora for Mobile"></a>Part 2: TikTok Video Editor – Filmora for Mobile</h2><p>Are you an avid TikTok user who likes creating fun and stunning videos to share with your followers?

Surely, playing PUBG on your mobile is fun and it is also more simple, but there is a limit that you can’t do on your mobile. When you are gaming, the flexibility of the keyboard and mouse are the best things ever. Then, can you play PUBG mobile on your PC or laptop?</p><p>In this part, I will let you know how you play PUBG on a PC and how to connect with a PC voice changer. Tencent just launched its official PUBG Mobile emulator which enables you to play it even on a PC or a laptop. For those who want to have flexibility without limitation, you better watch the steps on how you play PUBG mobile on your PC below:</p><p>Step1 Download and install the Tencent Gaming Buddy emulator</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-6.jpg"                      alt="click download"                ></p><p>Download Tencent Buddy Emulator, then run the software and it will download the required files automatically. It takes about 10-15 minutes to install it.</p><p>Step2 Download the additional files</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-7.jpg"                      alt="download additional files"                ></p><p>When the emulator is installed, launch the game. It will download some necessary files required to launch the game. Make sure you have good internet connectivity since these files are large.</p><p>Step3 Get your chicken dinner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-8.jpg"                      alt="you are done"                ></p><p>When finish downloading all the additional files, log in with your credentials to import all your mobile PUBG stats. All the controls are in a tab towards the right side of the screen, enter full-screen mode by pressing F11. Since PUBG servers detect emulators, you and your friends will only be paired with other players running this emulator.</p><p>Then, you may ask, “How do I connect with a PC voice changer?” No worries, I will let you know too. For your information, free voice changers are much easier to find on PC. There are some good voice changers for PUBG such as Clownfish, Voicemod, and MorphVOX. I will give you the steps to connect with Clownfish in PUBG:</p><p>Step1 Download and launch Clownfish</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-9.jpg"                      alt="set voice changer"                ></p><p>Download the software, then launch it. After that select “Set Voice Changer” and select any desired sound effects.</p><p>Step2 Click on “Hear Microphone”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-10.jpg"                      alt="hear the voice effects"                ></p><p>Click on “Hear Microphone” and hear the voice effects. Turn that off when you have chosen your favorite effect and you are done.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone"><a href="#Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone"></a>Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone</h2><p>After you know the voice changer on your phone and your PC for PUBG, what is another alternative you can do to change your voice in PUBG? Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it’s really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?</h2><p>Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Creative-Use-of-Secondary-Camera-Work"><a href="#Creative-Use-of-Secondary-Camera-Work" class="headerlink" title="Creative Use of Secondary Camera Work"></a>Creative Use of Secondary Camera Work</h2><p>B roll is a phrase used to describe supplemental video, which is frequently used as cutaway video to add visuals and context to your tale. The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1. B roll In TV And Movies"></a>1. B roll In TV And Movies</h2><p>Broll is an acronym for “background” or “behind,” respectively. It usually refers to extra footage captured with a movie camera while keeping the lighting consistent between scenes in the movie industry. When the filmmaker doesn’t want to show any dialogue or action on screen but needs some movement within the frame, it might be utilized as filler.</p><p>B roll has been used from the first silent movies, including D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film “Intolerance.” Griffith’s creative application All of the shots that are used in a movie or television show are collectively referred to as “b roll footage.” To add context and complexity to the production being recorded, these shots are frequently seen on screen in quick succession.</p><p>B roll can be utilized for establishing shots as well as close-ups of items. It is used by filmmakers when they lack the funds for pricey films or when they want to showcase their originality. It’s also a fantastic method for narrating stories devoid of conversation. It might be anything, such a view of a landscape or a person’s hands holding up a sign with words on it.</p><p>For instance, wider shots are frequently used when someone is giving a speech while seated behind a podium so that we can see both them and their surroundings, such as audience members standing close and applauding or security personnel.</p><h2 id="2-Methods-to-use-b-roll"><a href="#2-Methods-to-use-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods to use b roll"></a>2. Methods to use b roll</h2><p>Now that there are so many stock footage platforms, you have a lot of choices when you need just the right scene for your project. Most of the time, filmmakers don’t use B roll footage. One good way to use it is to use it as a way to move from one scene to the next. It can also be used to set the mood for an event or show what time of day it is when filming.</p><p>The ideal way to use B roll is to put it behind interviews. This kind of footage can be used in three ways: as establishing shots, cutaways, and transitions. Most of the time, the first few minutes of an interview or video help set the scene with “establishing shots.”</p><p>On the other hand, cutaways can show how different people react to what is being said in an interview. After all, transitions are commonly used to switch from one person’s experience with a certain topic to another person’s experience with the same topic. All of these different kinds of footage give filmmakers and videographers more freedom to tell their stories without relying too much on dialogue or narration.</p><h2 id="3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3. What types of b roll are there?"></a>3. What types of b roll are there?</h2><p>We’ll examine the top 5 uses for B rolls across a variety of video genres and discuss how to implement them effectively in your own projects.</p><h3 id="1-Archival-b-roll-footage"><a href="#1-Archival-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Archival b roll footage"></a>1. Archival b roll footage</h3><p>Aerial B roll is the solution when you like to show your viewers where your film is being recorded or when you are changing locations and want them to know it. The plane takes off and lands in another city, and then shots of the city, its landmarks, its famous streets, etc. are shown. You have probably seen this type of B roll footage in movies and TV shows. These images aid in putting the viewer in the character’s current location. Check out this collection of setting images from the Neighbors television series.</p><h3 id="2-Visual-detail-b-roll-footage"><a href="#2-Visual-detail-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Visual detail b roll footage"></a>2. Visual detail b roll footage</h3><p>Including archival material in your video allows your audience to experience a previously covered or historically significant story as it occurred. Look at this illustration from Netflix’s 14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible, which was made utilizing old b roll film from the era to help the viewer connect with the narrative.</p><h3 id="3-Storytelling-b-roll-footage"><a href="#3-Storytelling-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="3. Storytelling b roll footage"></a>3. Storytelling b roll footage</h3><p>B roll footage can be used to tell a story that supports the narrative of your video. For example, in this video interview of Tom DeLonge, the speaker talks about living in a neighborhood. The B rolls show him driving around in his car, skateboarding on the street in the 90’s. These add to the story the video creator wants to talk about not seeing people with a disability differently.</p><h3 id="4-Undirected-b-roll-footage"><a href="#4-Undirected-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="4. Undirected b roll footage"></a>4. Undirected b roll footage</h3><p>This particular kind of B roll film is captured without any direction being given to your character, as the name suggests. For the purposes of an interview video, for instance, these can be straightforward close-up views of your character’s hands and facial expressions. On the other hand, while you’re doing a documentary, you might record your subject participating in everyday activities.</p><h3 id="5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage"><a href="#5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="5. Atmospheric b roll footage"></a>5. Atmospheric b roll footage</h3><p>When you are sharing a narrative that has been told in the past or that has historical significance, incorporating archival material into your video gives your audience the opportunity to see the story as it occurred at the time. This is especially useful when you are discussing a narrative that has been experienced in the past or that has futuristic relevance.</p><p>Have a look at the scenes from the episode “14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible” that can be found on Netflix. As a result of the use of archive film footage of b roll from the relevant time period in its production, the audience is able to connect with the narrative on a deeper level.</p><h3 id="6-Pick-up-shots"><a href="#6-Pick-up-shots" class="headerlink" title="6. Pick-up shots"></a>6. Pick-up shots</h3><p>A pick-up is a tiny shot added to previously captured material. Re-shoots involve redoing entire scenes. Both types of shots are commonly added during film editing to fix, logic, continuity, or quality flaws. These photos happen a while after the sets have been taken down, clothes and props stowed, and the actors and crew have gone on to new projects.</p><p>If flaws were discovered during primary photography, the directors could have requested another take. The producer and director should weigh the cost of rejoining cast and crew against the need for pick-ups or re-shoots to address storyline flaws (or worse) in the final edit.</p><h3 id="7-A-roll-vs-b-roll"><a href="#7-A-roll-vs-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="7. A roll vs b roll"></a>7. A roll vs b roll</h3><p>Imagine the A roll as part of the video’s story. This could be a documentary film, news show, or scripted sketch. Everything else on your editing table must be rearranged to fit it. When the speaker in the following video is directly talking to the camera or interviewer, this is A roll footage. The video’s most crucial segments were filmed with primary footage.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We sincerely hope that this post will be of use to you in making your films more cinematic. You not only know how to film and edit your videos utilizing B rolls, you also have an extremely effective hack that allows you to generate amazing videos using stock footage. This is both impressive and unique.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-deciphering-the-skies-with-yuneecs-typhoon-uav/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Deciphering the Skies with Yuneec’s Typhoon UAV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-dynamic-directionality-prime-phone-friendly-tripods/"><u>2024 Approved  Dynamic Directionality  Prime Phone-Friendly Tripods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/revolutionary-guide-to-iphone-x-animoji-mastery/"><u>Revolutionary Guide to iPhone X Animoji Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-filmoras-prime-selective-screen-change-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Filmora's Prime Selective Screen Change List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-discover-a-world-of-creative-slide-show-patterns-at-no-cost/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Discover a World of Creative Slide Show Patterns at No Cost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-simplified-approach-to-crafting-professional-time-lapse-videos-in-gopro-studio/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Simplified Approach to Crafting Professional Time Lapse Videos in GoPro Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-night-avenger-black-vs-day-defender-silver/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Night Avenger (Black) VS Day Defender (Silver)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-elite-meme-design-software/"><u>[New] Elite Meme Design Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transform-your-file-management-free-cloud-storage-service-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Transform Your File Management - Free Cloud Storage Service Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-above-par-editing-software-for-ios-and-android-smartphones/"><u>2024 Approved  Above-Par Editing Software for iOS & Android Smartphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-10-best-tools-to-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-from-iphone-8-plus-you-should-try-out-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, The 10 Best Tools to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock From iPhone 8 Plus You Should Try Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-without-losing-data-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Upgrade Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max without Losing Data?

In case of Gear 360 you will be able to enjoy 4K resolution whereas LG 360 serves with 2K resolution only thus <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Samsung Gear 360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be better choice in this case. On the other side if we talk about audio abilities then LG360 has an edge over Samsung Gear 360 because of its ability to record 5.1 level surround sounds that is major requirement of a 360 degree video. The Gear 360 possess stereo record feature that can capture voice only in two directions thus resultant audio in scenes is not that much clear. Moving forward to more technical specifications, the bit rate – well known as quality of image with resolution is 60MB&#x2F;second in case of Gear 360 whereas LG360 cam limits up to 19MB&#x2F;second, this makes a big difference in quality. If we count features then Samsung gear 360 definitely have more features as like its waterproof body, highly stabilized video results and F2.0 dual lenses but LG360 lacks behind in these features.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison"><a href="#Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison"></a>Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison</h2><p>It is possible to stitch videos as well as photographs taken from the 360 degree camera using Galaxy phone and they can be directly shared on social media. Some consumers also love to use Desktop software to edit the camera results in detail. Same as like Gear 360, the latest device from LG can also capture good quality 360 degree videos as well as photographs but it do not support spherical share as like Samsung unit. You can pair up LG360 cam only with LG G5 latest smartphone whereas video and photo editing options are not yet known for smartphone as well as PC. Both these devices come with Wi-Fi connectivity, USB port and Bluetooth capabilities whereas in case of Samsung 360 gear NFC is an additional option. The ultimate combination of time lapse recording, 360 spherical recording and loop recording makes everything easy in Samsung gear where you can avail wonderful results for each real time recording.</p><p>Check this side-by-side video review to know more about this two 360 degree cameras:</p><h2 id="Part-5-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Conclusion"></a>Part 5 Conclusion</h2><p>Price difference of both devices is well reflected in the comparison table above and you got enough information about their features too. The gear 360 results better looking images along with better color distributions but in case of LG the image as well as video quality is comparatively degraded; Although, LG cam is much faster and discrete design but for professional photographers it will not result better output. The two additional shooting modes of Gear 360 also allows better quality of videos and its compatibility with Samsung smartphones allows easy editing and uploading. After getting real time users recommendations and their reviews, users are advised to prefer Samsung GEAR 360 for their Virtual Reality needs but those who cannot compromise for price range can go for LG360 device as its audio quality is much better than Samsung gear 360 along with ability to connect with Android as well as iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comparison-of-googles-ar-embellishments-to-competitors/"><u>2024 Approved  Comparison of Google's AR Embellishments to Competitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-links-between-instagram-and-tiktok/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating Links Between Instagram and TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-breakdown-of-vivacuts-new-tools-and-features/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step Breakdown of VivaCut's New Tools and Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-skyward-haven-of-the-pennywise-clouds-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Skyward Haven of the Pennywise Clouds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-head-to-head-evaluating-google-cardboard-and-samsungs-vr-world/"><u>[New] In 2024, Head-to-Head  Evaluating Google Cardboard and Samsung’s VR World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/in-2024-tamil-trax-download-edit-and-sync-songs-as-mobile-ringtone/"><u>In 2024, Tamil Trax  Download, Edit & Sync Songs as Mobile Ringtone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-millisecond-metrics-for-a-20mb-digital-creation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Millisecond Metrics for a 20MB Digital Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-audio-format-switches-srt-to-ssa-and-more/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Audio Format Switches  SRT to SSA & More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-personalize-your-viewing-experience-building-a-google-cardboard-vr-setup-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Personalize Your Viewing Experience  Building a Google Cardboard VR Setup for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unleashing-visual-potential-is-pickup-the-pinnacle-of-android-editing-tools/"><u>[New] Unleashing Visual Potential  Is PickUp the Pinnacle of Android Editing Tools?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-boost-your-visuals-video-enhance-pro-22-guide/"><u>In 2024, Boost Your Visuals -

After all, a longer flight life means the longer you have to make sure you get your perfect shot (video or still frame,) or are able to more thoroughly inspect whatever it is you are looking to inspect. Basically, at the end of the day a longer flight time directly relates to having more fun.</p><p>While it is true that you can (and should) carry some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >extra batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with you while piloting your drone, stopping what you are doing to change batteries out can be a real hassle, and a drain on your productivity.

GIFs are better alternatives for users who want to send more realistic reaction icons. Do you want to turn a GIF file you saved on your mobile phone into an animated sticker? Well, it is extremely easy, but you have to rely on a third-party app.</p><h2 id="How-Do-I-Turn-a-GIF-into-a-Sticker"><a href="#How-Do-I-Turn-a-GIF-into-a-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Turn a GIF into a Sticker?"></a>How Do I Turn a GIF into a Sticker?</h2><p>It is possible to use a <strong>GIF to sticker converter</strong> to change the GIF format files into stickers. One suitable tool here is the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/" >Wondershare UniConverter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The software, available for both Mac and Windows devices, is suitable for creating GIFs and stickers alike. You can adjust the output size and framerate and transform the GIF file you create further into sticker-appropriate WebP format.</p><p>Furthermore, you can choose to store this in your device or cloud memory, as necessary. Follow the steps below to turn your GIFs into stickers at ease.</p><p>Step1 Install the Wondershare Unicoverter on your PC or Mac.</p><p>Step2 You should click on the “<strong>Tools</strong>“ tab after launching the software on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-1.jpg"                      alt="click on tools"                ></p><p>Step3 Under this, choose the “<strong>GIF Maker</strong>” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-2.jpg"                      alt="choose gif maker option"                ></p><p>Step4 Select the side for “<strong>Photos to GIF</strong>” on the next window that appears to add your image and “<strong>Videos to GIF</strong>” for a video file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-3.jpg"                      alt="select the side for photos to gif"                ></p><p>Step5 Add the image&#x2F;video clip after clicking on the “<strong>Add</strong>” button.</p><p>Step6 Make changes to the Output parameters and Frame Rate, and click on the “<strong>Create GIF</strong>” button.</p><p>Step7 After creating the GIF, go to the UniConverter home page again and click on “<strong>Image Converter</strong>“.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-4.jpg"                      alt="click on image converter"                ></p><p>Step8 Choose the conversion model to WEBP and click the <strong>tickbox</strong> for the File.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-5.jpg"                      alt="choose conversion model to webp"                ></p><p>Step9 Press the Convert button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-6.jpg"                      alt="press the convert button"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-convert-a-GIF-to-a-Discord-sticker"><a href="#How-to-convert-a-GIF-to-a-Discord-sticker" class="headerlink" title="How to convert a GIF to a Discord sticker?"></a>How to convert a GIF to a Discord sticker?</h2><p>There are tools available for users to convert GIFs to stickers specifically for communication&#x2F;streaming-based platforms like Discord. The process of using UniConverter would not work here, though, since the supported format for stickers is APNG. That is not available under this software at this point.</p><p>It would help if you used an online tool for GIF to APNG conversion, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.aconvert.com/image/gif-to-apng/" >AConvert.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step1 Open the online tool on your browser, and click on <strong>File</strong> to choose the source location type.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-7.jpg"                      alt="click on files"                ></p><p>Step2 Tap the “<strong>Choose File</strong>” option and add the main GIF you want to convert from your device&#x2F;cloud. Bottom of Form</p><p>Step3 Choose the Output format as APNG. Set the image size and quality specifications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-8.jpg"                      alt="choose output format as apng"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on the “<strong>Convert Now</strong>“ button. The File would store on your device, and you can use it on Discord as stickers.</p><h2 id="How-to-put-your-GIFs-into-animated-WhatsApp-stickers"><a href="#How-to-put-your-GIFs-into-animated-WhatsApp-stickers" class="headerlink" title="How to put your GIFs into animated WhatsApp stickers?"></a>How to put your GIFs into animated WhatsApp stickers?</h2><p>Much like the process of converting GIF to stickers using the regular UniConverter tool, you can also use that or other apps to prepare GIFs for WhatsApp-based stickers. In this case, ensure the <strong>gif to sticker WhatsApp</strong> aspect ratio settings are set to 512 x 512 pixels since that is what the app supports. However, this would help create some standard-level stickers mainly.</p><p>Step1 Open your WhatsApp application on the phone and access the chat of the person you would send it to.</p><p>Step2 Click on the paperclip or media icon and insert the video on your device through that section. Alternatively, you can click on the camera to directly record a video using the slider icon above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-9.jpg"                      alt="click on paperclip or media"                ></p><p>Keep the video around 6 seconds long. If it extends further, cut it to 6 seconds maximum.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-10.jpg"                      alt="keep the video around 6seconds long"                ></p><p>Step3 You can add stickers, icons, or text to the video.</p><p>Step4 There is a GIF icon beside the video option. Click on it and press the “<strong>Send</strong>” button to your contact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-11.jpg"                      alt="click on gif icon"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-turn-a-GIF-to-a-Telegram-sticker"><a href="#How-to-turn-a-GIF-to-a-Telegram-sticker" class="headerlink" title="How to turn a GIF to a Telegram sticker?"></a>How to turn a GIF to a Telegram sticker?</h2><p>You can use either the Uniconverter or AConvert tool to turn your image&#x2F;video into a GIF file. For sharing on Telegram, you have to use the same process through UniConverter’s Image Converter to change the images into 512 x 512-pixel dimensions. Then, add the pack in Telegram as a new sticker pack.</p><p>Step1 Access the Telegram app through the PC and open the chatbot function for Sticker through Search. The ID here is @Stickers.</p><p>Step2 Open the chat, type &#x2F;newpack.Press the Enter button. Again, give a name to the sticker pack and click on Enter.</p><p>Step3 Click on the File icon and add the GIF file from your device.</p><p>Step4 Assign a relatable emoji with the File and press Enter. Do the same for all files.</p><p>Step5 Add all stickers and type &#x2F;publish. Then, tap the Enter button.</p><p>Step6 Set the sticker pack’s unique URL name and share the stickers inside individually or altogether.</p><h2 id="How-to-custom-GIF-stickers-with-a-video-editor"><a href="#How-to-custom-GIF-stickers-with-a-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="How to custom GIF stickers with a video editor?"></a>How to custom GIF stickers with a video editor?</h2><p>While you can use the steps mentioned to turn GIFs into Telegram-based stickers, having a universal tool to make high-quality GIFs first would help.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is useful for creating interesting video files.

The file size is unknown until you have the completed produced video. The terms 20MB and 20Mb are not interchangeable.</p><p>The problem is that a 30-second iPhone recording might easily exceed 100MB in size. 1024 MB or less than 20 minutes. What is the length of a video that is 25 megabytes?</p><p>At 30 frames per second, a raw HD video will require 5MBx30 150MB of storage space. Does anyone know how many MB a 30-second VGA video at 30 frames per second would take up on a memory stick?</p><p> For the raw footage, we’ll need roughly 540GB per hour.</p><p>Bits per second (bps) is the unit of measurement for network transmissions. Even if you have a premium Nitro account, you cannot upload long videos larger than 20MB. - 1080p video size: 258 MB</p><p>As a result, 20MBps is 160Mbps. 1024 bytes per kilobyte. I’d have to look into what kind of file that is.</p><p>How long does a 25MB video last? Each uncompressed frame is approximately 5MB in size.</p><p>Once you have the file size, all you have to do is guess how many times it will be seen. The video file size formula can now be used to address how to compute video file size. TVs that stream video.</p><p>A DVD with excellent quality content holds 47 gigabytes, or little more than 2. I’m using a laptop as a projector, but I also need it to connect to a second TV. 8 Mbps Youtube HD 1080p25</p><p>30 frames per second vs 15 fps. Depending on the aforementioned, a 30-second video could be anywhere from 1 to 30 megabytes. The 400 MB video file will download in less than 11 minutes over a. - 25 Mb seconds.</p><p>If the video is only 2 or 3 minutes long, you should be able to compress the file size significantly. That means one frame in a 4K video file with an 8-bit Bit Depth is 84375 MB in size. Alternatively, 20Mbps is 25MBps.</p><p>That is 20 megabits per second. As a result, many people worry if they can transfer large films through Discord without Nitro. The LG smart television turns on for a few seconds before turning off.</p><p>Many of our storage drives are incapable of writing to disk at that speed. Seconds of 20MB video When I try to edit my video in a video editor, it claims that the resolution is not supported. As a result, 1 minute 60 seconds.</p><p>So 70778880 bits &#x3D; 84375 MB (8 x 1024 × 1024 MB). What is the maximum video length that can be uploaded on Facebook? 25md is equal to how many seconds of video.</p><p>- 1 minute, 25-megabyte video. How many megabytes are there? 3200 Mb 5 Mbps download time</p><p>A minute is equal to 60 seconds. I make 30 seconds 320 x 240 videos that are roughly 12 MB in size.</p><p><strong>How to create a longer video in a 20Mb video (introduce Filmora to change video bitrate or resolution to create a longer video)</strong></p><p>When exporting video, you may have come across the term “bitrate” on occasion. Then you’re probably wondering what bitrate is. Is it related to the quality of my video? Don’t be concerned. Many readers, including yourself, have similar reservations.</p><p>We will explain what video bitrate is and how video bitrate and quality are related in this article. Finally, we’ll show you how to alter the video bitrate as a bonus and have a longer video. Continue to read!</p><p><strong>What is the bitrate of the video?</strong></p><p>The entire amount of video data transferred in a given period is known as the video bitrate. To put it another way, each video file has its own set of data that must be sent in order to play it on multiple devices. Video bitrate is the pace at which this data is conveyed over a certain time interval. Video bitrate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It’s also important to remember that videos with a higher bitrate typically have a greater file size.</p><p><strong>Does higher video bitrate mean better video quality?</strong></p><p>When looking at the same video with the same resolution, a greater bitrate will accommodate higher image quality in the video output. Bitrates are projected to increase when the resolution is increased and more data is handled.</p><p>As a result, while a high video bitrate can give amazing quality, it can also put a lot of load on your hardware, causing stutters.</p><p><strong>How to change the bitrate of a video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Filmora can be used to change the bitrate of video files. It has a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of media formats, allowing you to quickly and easily change the bitrate of your media files.</p><ul><li><strong>Import Video -Bring the video files in.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-many-seconds-video-1.jpg"                      alt="how-many-seconds-video-"                ></p><p>Run Video Editor after installing it.

Video bitrate is the pace at which this data is conveyed over a certain time interval. Video bitrate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It’s also important to remember that videos with a higher bitrate typically have a greater file size.</p><p><strong>Does higher video bitrate mean better video quality?</strong></p><p>When looking at the same video with the same resolution, a greater bitrate will accommodate higher image quality in the video output.
