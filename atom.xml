This template is fully customizable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/feature-action-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="feature action ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="2-Arrive-After-Effects-Title-Template"><a href="#2-Arrive-After-Effects-Title-Template" class="headerlink" title="2.

Its minimalistic effect makes it an ideal solution for a wide range of genres and it is fully customizable, meaning that you can change the colors and text as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/arrive-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="arrive ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="3-Laser-After-Effects-Title-Templates"><a href="#3-Laser-After-Effects-Title-Templates" class="headerlink" title="3.

If you want your audience to be captivated more by the content of the video than the title, the Black &amp; White Template may be the best solution. But like most After Effects title templates, it is entirely customizable, meaning that you can choose to keep its minimalistic design while changing the overall color scheme.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/black-white-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="black white ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="5-Cyber-Brush-Titles-After-Effects-Template"><a href="#5-Cyber-Brush-Titles-After-Effects-Template" class="headerlink" title="5.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4.

The Yi 4k action cam appears more trendy and sleek with its smooth plastic finish and the attractive rounded corners. Whereas, SJ6 has a rugged appearance with rubberized material that provides textured finish with added grip. You will also find few indicating LEDs on SJ6 body.</p><p> Yi Action cam is designed with a 2.19” LCD screen but SJ6 has little smaller up to 2” only. You will find MicroSD and MicroUSB slots on Yi’s body but in case of SJ6, MiniUSB, MicroSD and Micro HDMI make connectivity much easier. Another difference lies in their buttons as Yi 4K has only on button on its body but you will find 3 control buttons on SJ6 Legend.</p><h4 id="Accessories"><a href="#Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Accessories"></a>Accessories</h4><p> Second noticeable difference is in accessories of both action cam units. Note that, both of these companies are offering cameras with threaded tripod type hole on bottom side of their body so that users can easily attach them to mounts. But you will find more flexibility with SJ6 as its box includes all necessary mounts that can meet action recording needs with ease. On the other side, Yi 4K box does not even offer a waterproof case to buyers. You have to make all the expenses yourself to fulfill your needs. You will find so many expensive combos for Yi accessories over online stores.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >More Accessories You May Need <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p> In this case, Yi 4K action cam wins the battle with its ability to record 4k videos tirelessly up to 120 minutes with 30fps setting. For SJ6 legend, you will be able to enjoy maximum recording time up to 70 minutes with 4K settings at 25 fps. It is essential to keep Wi-Fi and screen off to gain this much performance from SJ6 otherwise you will find faster decay in battery percentage. Yi 4k battery is designed with fine tuned advanced power management system that leads to higher service capacity.</p><h4 id="Waterproof"><a href="#Waterproof" class="headerlink" title="Waterproof"></a>Waterproof</h4><p> If you are a underwater adventure lover then Yi 4K cannot provide your more satisfactory service because it can go underwater up to 40 meters and this dive is not possible without protective case. The sad part is that the camera box doesn’t include case so you have to make additional payment to buy it. SJ6 legend is designed to offer impressive underwater performance with its ability to go underwater up to 30 meters with ease and a sturdy, sleek, well designed waterproof case is included in its package.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance-Comparison"><a href="#Features-and-Performance-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance Comparison"></a>Features and Performance Comparison</h2><h4 id="Video-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#Video-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video and Image Quality"></a>Video and Image Quality</h4><p> When we moved to the video quality test then Yi 4K offered quite appealing results. This camera is designed with native 4k resolution so that crystal clear footage can be recorded with impressive results. But in case of SJ6 you will find interpolated 4K technology; it means that your device actually captures all details in 2K resolution mode but the final footage get produced with 4K result where additional 2K is increased with addition of fake pixels during processing. The image quality with such interpolated system goes really bad. But if you compare performance of both devices at Full HD 1080p resolution level then you will be able to find impressive quality with Yi cam and it also provides support to 120fps frame rate at 1080p.</p><h4 id="Audio-Quality"><a href="#Audio-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality"></a>Audio Quality</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Yi 4K action cam support 360 degree omni directional coverage with microphones and it also has powerful built in speakers. Yi 4K action cam is capable enough to record stereo sound at 48 kHz. This unit is commonly used for recording outdoor sports events due to its optimized sound effect. SJ6 also extends support to external mic with 100% guarantee to overall coverage. This camera is commonly used to shoot footage at small concerts, or home get-togethers.</p><h4 id="Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization"></a>Image Stabilization</h4><p> If you are found of recording videos on the go then SJ6 Gyro Stabilizer feature can serve you with better results. Simply turn on Gyro mode during your recordings and it will adjust all ups and downs during motion recordings. No matter whether you are going to attach your camera to handlebar or wish to place it on helmet; this camera with ensure quality results in all cases. In case of Yi 4K you will be able to avail electronic image stabilization for 2.7K resolution level. It is designed using 3 axis type gyroscope and also includes 3-axis accelerometer to ensure smooth recording on the go. The cross border compensation feature makes videos more stable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> By comparing all the features, readers will find more reasons to buy Yi 4K action camera.

And it supports 4K real-time video transmission from up to 2 km away. It has almost compacted every sensor in Phantom 4 inside Mavic Pro. It is an excellent choice for small unmanned aerial vehicles (From 24th May, the best choice is DJI Spark). However, the public has not officially seen an accessory that was revealed in the conference. This is DJI Goggles – a first person perspective FPV flying glasses that has resolution comparable to VR glasses. Now, it is finally online on <a class="link"   href="https://www.dji.com/dji-goggles" >DJI website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

What is Head Tracking"></a>#1. What is Head Tracking</h6><p> Like remote controller sticks, you can now use head movements to control both aircraft yaw and camera tilt in Head Tracking Flight mode. You can simply control turn left or right to yaw left or right, and straighten your head to stop turning. In Head Tracking Gimbal mode, you will not affect the jaw as only the gimbal will move.</p><h6 id="2-Experience-Fun-but-not-very-practical"><a href="#2-Experience-Fun-but-not-very-practical" class="headerlink" title="#2. Experience: Fun but not very practical"></a>#2. Experience: Fun but not very practical</h6><p> In the past, an unmanned drone is always separated by a mobile phone no matter how high the resolution of the graphic is. Now, you can have the image transmission directly displayed in your eyes. Through head tracking, you can achieve a similar effect to that of VR. It is very interesting.</p><p> But, in my opinion, these head tracking remains in a stage where it is only for playing once in a while, it is unlikely to be used in photo shooting mission for the long term. Here are the reasons:</p><ul><li>Frame rate is slightly lower, there are delays</li></ul><p> Mavic’s OcuSync image transmission works perfect on iPad, but it indeed caused dizziness on DJI Goggles.</p><p> To reduce the effect of dizziness, the ideal number of frames rate of Goggles is 120fps. PSVR’s 90 fps had caused a lot of complaints. But, with DJI Goggles, this number is lowered to the lowest 30fps. With 110s image transmission delay, any head rotation at any point will make anyone feel dizzy.</p><ul><li>Too sensitive</li></ul><p> The mission of 3-axis gimbal is to remove any camera shakes and stabilize the footage. But, the DJI Goggles’ head tracking actually bring back these shakes which do not come from the camera itself, but as a result of the commands of head tracking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975555">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975555">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975555%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975555/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tapfly"><a href="#Tapfly" class="headerlink" title="Tapfly"></a>Tapfly</h3><h6 id="1-What-is-Tapfly"><a href="#1-What-is-Tapfly" class="headerlink" title="#1.

Experience"></a>#2. Experience</h6><p> DJI Goggles’s main interaction needs to be done through the touchpad. This touchpad supports swipe and clicks of single and double fingers. It is responsive to unusual speed. Sometimes it is too sensitive that occasionally, a swipe will be misunderstood as a click. In the case of a fault in touch, we can use double fingers to slide back to lock the touchpad.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> As DJI’s first generation digital image transmission FPV goggles, I think it has a lot of room for improvement. Although Many software issues and hardware design still need to be improved, I think it worth to try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983575">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983575.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983575">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983575.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983575%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983575/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-demystifying-the-viva-video-interface/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Demystifying the Viva Video Interface</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-master-content-analysis-discovering-the-best-7-budget-friendly-youtube-taggification-tools/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Master Content Analysis Discovering the Best 7 Budget-Friendly YouTube Taggification Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-speed-capture-faceoff-gopro-hero-4-challenges-ghost-s/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Speed Capture Faceoff GoPro Hero 4 Challenges Ghost-S</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-beat-to-visuals-an-iphone-guide-for-music-videos/"><u>[New] Beat to Visuals An iPhone Guide for Music Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-hues-harmony-an-editors-guide-to-perfect-grading/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Hues Harmony An Editor's Guide to Perfect Grading</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-giggle-grind-exploring-twitters-comedy-gold/"><u>[Updated] Giggle Grind Exploring Twitters' Comedy Gold</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-gamers-edition-obs-studio-streaming/"><u>2024 Approved Gamers' Edition OBS Studio Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/7-essential-tricks-for-a-seamless-iphone-vpn-connection/"><u>7 Essential Tricks for a Seamless iPhone VPN Connection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/boosting-website-personalization-using-advanced-cookiebot-solutions/"><u>Boosting Website Personalization Using Advanced Cookiebot Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-send-and-fake-live-location-on-facebook-messenger-of-your-honor-play-40c-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Honor Play 40C | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/root-access-explained-unleashing-your-androids-full-potential-or-inviting-trouble/"><u>Root Access Explained: Unleashing Your Android's Full Potential or Inviting Trouble?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/the-secret-life-of-a-designer-canvas-hidden-edits/"><u>The Secret Life of a Designer Canva's Hidden Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-podcast-names-plus-50plus-podcast-name-ideas-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Podcast Names (Plus 50+ Podcast Name Ideas) for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s one of the world’s most extensive podcast streaming services. So how did it get there? And how can you get on the platform yourself?</p><p>This article dives deep into Apple’s podcast strategy. It includes how to submit to Apple Podcasts, why you should and how to improve your chances of getting on the platform.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission"></a>Part 1. Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission</h2><p>Apple Podcasts submission is an excellent opportunity to earn severe exposure to your podcast. It would be best to start by sending your show to Apple for review. Then, we’ll help you with the steps to get your podcast accepted on Apple Podcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Apple Podcasts is not a podcast-hosting site. You’re not uploading your audio files to Apple. Instead, you’re telling Apple where to find your audio files on the web. Apple finds your files via an RSS feed that links to your hosting site.</p><h3 id="Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site"><a href="#Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site" class="headerlink" title="Publish an episode on a hosting site"></a>Publish an episode on a hosting site</h3><p>The first requirement of Apple Podcasts is a published episode. You need to give Apple a list to start. It can be a trailer or your first podcast episode posted on a hosting site. You can use any hosting service to publish your episode. One of the best is <a class="link"   href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/" >buzzsprout <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which offers hosting services, promotion, and marketing opportunities for podcasters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-1.jpg"                      alt="buzzsprout website"                ></p><p>A podcast hosting site stores your podcast files and distributes them to various podcast streaming platforms using an RSS feed. Your hosting site will automatically submit your podcast to podcast streaming platforms. But with the Apple podcast, you will have to submit manually only once.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Submit-Podcasts-to-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Submit-Podcasts-to-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Submit Podcasts to Apple Podcasts?</h2><p>If you’re not submitting your podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’re missing out on the opportunity to earn revenue from ads and sponsorships. So we set out to find the easiest way to submit a podcast to Apple Podcasts and make it easy for everyone else.</p><p>After publishing your first episode to a podcast hosting site, there are a few required fields that you can find on settings:</p><ul><li>Podcast description</li><li>Podcast artwork (square)</li><li>Apple Podcasts category</li><li>Language selection</li><li>Explicit checkbox</li></ul><p>It’s time to submit your show to Apple Podcasts.</p><p>Step1 Go to Apple Podcasts directory instructions in Buzzsprout and click ‘Get listed.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-2.jpg"                      alt="click get listed"                ></p><p>Step2 You can see that we have already done steps 1 and 2, according to Apple. Now scroll down, and you’ll find your RSS feed URL.

We capture multiple images of the same subject or a scene with slightly different exposure and then mix all the images into a final perfect photograph.</p><p>A portrait is one of the most liked genres of photography, especially on the occasions of weddings, get-togethers, meet-ups, and many more. A good portrait photograph can capture a person’s detailed personality and emotions.</p><p>The camera can perform fantastic functions, but it is still a machine at the end of the day, and its sensors have limitations. But by the HDR technique, you can create a scene closer to what the human eye sees.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn how to shoot and create impressive HDR portraits, whether a beginner or a professional. We have written about creating both still and moving HDR portraits in an easy way.</p><p>People often find it challenging to shoot a perfect HDR photograph from a phone camera. In this tutorial, we will answer some common questions on how to create an impressive HDR portrait.

Still, it is very time-consuming, and the chances of the subject moving during the shoot also increase.</p><p>So almost all DSLRs come with this beneficial feature of bracketing. You can check the user manual of your device to activate this feature. For some devices, it is started by a single click, while in some, it is hidden deep in the menu. Once you start it, you have to select the number of images you want to take and the increase in exposure after every snap.</p><p>Usually, three shots are ideal for HDR portraits as the chances of moving decrease. Nowadays, many latest DSLRs have the option of automatic exposure bracketing as it provides the photographer with different levels of exposure in a single click without spending valuable time adjusting camera settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-2.jpg"                      alt="moving decrease"                ></p><p>Once you are done with your bracketing settings, all you have to do is press and hold the shutter, and your specified number of photos will be taken, each with a different exposure value.</p><h3 id="Some-Useful-Tips-to-Remember"><a href="#Some-Useful-Tips-to-Remember" class="headerlink" title="Some Useful Tips to Remember"></a>Some Useful Tips to Remember</h3><ol><li><strong>Try to Keep the Subject Still</strong></li></ol><p>HDR portrait shooting takes time as you have to take 3-5 images of your subject.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Vivid-Color-Equilibrium"><a href="#Vivid-Color-Equilibrium" class="headerlink" title="Vivid Color Equilibrium"></a>Vivid Color Equilibrium</h2><p><em>Before you start working on any video editing, you need to have a good overall understanding of working with color in video. To guide you through the process, we’ll explain the basics of color and outline the best color editing software packages and apps for fine-tuning the colors in your footage.</em></p><p>Color sorting is an exciting practice of patience, skillful tinkering, and a feeling for atmosphere. Creating stellar looks for a photo or video is a fun way to create a visual experience while maintaining a level of artistic integrity. While advanced artists may prefer larger software programs like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, there are excellent, simpler applications built entirely for beginners. In fact, you don’t have to be a beginner to use these apps, as many of them use more manual controls for precise adjustments. The advancements readily available for iOS and iPad these days are stellar, and we’re here to help point you in the right direction.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-correction"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color correction?"></a>Part 1. What is color correction?</h2><p>Color correction refers to the process of adjusting each clip of footage to meet a consistent standard of appearance. Basically, it’s about correcting the underlying image issues by balancing the colors, making white appear white, black appear black, and making sure everything is even. The goal is to match the video footage to a standard that would accurately represent how the human eye would see it.</p><p>An example of this is when you are shooting outdoors during the day. During the day, the quality of the sun will change, and some shots of your video will not match. This is why color correction is important because it will make your video look like it was all shot at the same time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-app-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-color-correction-app"><a href="#Part-2-Best-color-correction-app" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Is it worth buying a camcorder?"></a>1. Is it worth buying a camcorder?</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons for buying camcorders is the lens. With DSLRs and mirrorless cameras coming to the forefront, people doubt the credibility of a camcorder. But camcorders have powerful and long zoom lenses with tiny imaging sensors, which makes it more powerful than any DSLR. It also comes with variable speed zoom control that can create smooth, slow zooms to reveal and introduce a location, or quick punch-ins to highlight the action. There are no limits in recording time with camcorders, which makes it ideal for event photography. Camcorders can be plugged into the socket to continue with videography when batteries are exhausted and have dedicated dials for adjusting volume levels. Therefore, camcorders are a better and worthy purchase.</p><h3 id="2-What-camcorder-do-YouTubers-use"><a href="#2-What-camcorder-do-YouTubers-use" class="headerlink" title="2.

For a hands-free point of view recording, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/video/tips-and-solutions/tips-using-gopro-cameras-video-production" >GoPro cameras are great <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. For professional and advanced level, the manual controls of GoPro can become a big problem. There are also a lack of buttons like shutter speed, aperture, etc. in GoPro, which makes it suitable only for timer setting shoots where you don’t need to adjust on the fly.</p><p>Another aspect where the camcorders wins the brownies is the image quality. The long built-in zoom and tiny sensors in the camcorders offer a variety of perspectives without cropping the image, as a GoPro does when select narrower fields of view.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>However, advanced and compact mode of videography get introduced, the camcorders has its advantages that cannot be ignored.

For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets? Below are recommendations of the best official public domain art websites. Kindly note that the list contains NGO and government sites, some of which may not be accessible in your area.</p><h3 id="1-Public-Domain-Pictures"><a href="#1-Public-Domain-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="1.

It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone.

For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts-1"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts-1" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history-1"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free-1"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Realizing-Dreamscapes-Picks-of-the-Best-Tools-for-Animation-Artists"><a href="#Realizing-Dreamscapes-Picks-of-the-Best-Tools-for-Animation-Artists" class="headerlink" title="Realizing Dreamscapes: Picks of the Best Tools for Animation Artists"></a>Realizing Dreamscapes: Picks of the Best Tools for Animation Artists</h2><p>Using software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos ready for uploading or release is fast and effective but first you have to get your files ready to import. We will be talking about 3d model creation today which is the first step in 3D animation creation. There are many options out there with their own advantages and drawbacks as well as price points and additional support via tutorials and in some cases assets to help speed up the creation process.</p><p>In every case you can always just buy ready-made models for your animations but in doing that you lose the option and the flexibility to have a completely custom asset with the ability to alter when needed.</p><p>There are many steps to creating that perfect video and in time you will have your preferred method. We call this our workflow. Achieving a comfortable workflow is one of the most important and influential processes you will undergo as a creative artist, this is due to the fact even with the best ideas and all the drive in the world, if you struggle to translate that into a 3d model then it stays in your head and no one will see it.</p><p>With this in mind let’s look at some of the options available to us and how we can use them for this first most important step in our creative process. Remember to pick one that does not limit your creativity and gives you the tools you need to translate thought into visualization.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="ZBrush-by-MAXON"><a href="#ZBrush-by-MAXON" class="headerlink" title="ZBrush by MAXON"></a>ZBrush by MAXON</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/zbrush-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="zbrush by maxon"                ></p><p>Zbrush is what is considered an industry standard 3D modeling software and is one of the most used by many leading studios. This is a paid software with different versions meeting different needs depending on what you feel you need. You can create impressive 3d models with very high levels of detail without overusing your computer resources resulting in a stable and fluid working process. Zbrush is very powerful with many features, too many features to highlight in this guide but as an overview some features that can improve your process are:</p><ul><li>You can import or create alphas easily for micro detailing.</li><li>There is a live boolean to create unique items within your sculpts.</li><li>It’s very easy to use the Zremesher to create a new clean topology of your sculptures.<br> Dynamesh lets you work and retopo as you go so the sculpt retains detail.</li><li>Work with multiple levels of divisions at the same time with the Sub Divide tools.</li></ul><p>This is just a tiny scratch on the surface of what ZBrush can do. There are all the tools you need within this software to create an amazing jaw dropping model for your videos but this is a paid software which is important to remember when making the decision to go with this one as you will need animation and rigging software as well as in some cases a UV editor. Another thing to remember is system requirements depending on your setup. Minimum system requirements are as follows:</p><p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p><ul><li>64-bit Windows 10 or 11 .</li><li>Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent with SSE2 technology or better.</li><li>4GB of ram with a strong recommendation for 6GB or more.</li><li>8GB of free hard drive space.</li><li>A graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 or higher and Vulkan 1.1 or higher.</li><li>Monitor with 32-bit color and a resolution of 1280x1024.</li><li>Mouse or Wacom compatible (WinTab API) pen tablet.</li></ul><p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Mac OSX: 10.14 or above</li><li>Everything else is the same as above.</li></ul><p>Zbrush runs the same on Windows and Mac so there is no advantage over the other and the only real elements that you need to consider is your CPU and your RAM, A faster CPU with more cores will make this program run more stable and 16GB or RAM or more will also help with stability so if your running an older computer this will still work but you may be limited to pixel count but that is true for all 3D creation software.</p><h2 id="Autodesk-Maya"><a href="#Autodesk-Maya" class="headerlink" title="Autodesk Maya"></a>Autodesk Maya</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/autodesk-maya.jpg"                      alt="autodesk maya"                ></p><p>This guide wouldn’t be complete without introducing Maya, Maya is another industry standard for modeling but also offers animation and rigging tools meaning this covers a lot more ground that some of the other 3D modeling software.</p><p>Maya is very powerful but for this guide I will only be talking about the 3D modeling creation tools as I feel other topics need their own space but that said I think it is important to mention this is a complete workflow from creation to the exportation of your movie file into Filmora ready for editing and uploading to your audience.</p><p>Again this software has a list of features that is simply too large to cover so i will highlight some useful features for your creative process.</p><ul><li>Polygon modeling lets you create 3D models based on vertexes, edges and faces.</li><li>Nurbs modeling lets you create 3d models from geometric primitives and drawn curves</li><li>Sculpting tools allows you to create organic sculpts</li><li>Subdivision workflow for better performance in higher pixel counts</li><li>Built in UV editing</li><li>Orthopedic viewport so you can check dimensions from whichever side you need</li></ul><p>Again we are only scratching the surface of what Maya can do. Maya is capable of creating hyper realistic hard surface and organic models for use within animation and also provides all the tools needed to get a perfect rendering. Again system performance is important to consider when choosing software and the minimum requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Windows 10 or 11, macOS x or above and linux but see website for compatibility.</li><li>64-bit Intel or AMD multi-core processor with SSE4.2, M series Mac under rosetta 2.</li><li>8GB of RAM but 16GB or more is recommended.</li><li>7GB free disk space for the install.</li><li>Three-button mouse.</li><li>Graphics card please see website for compatibility</li></ul><p>This is a paid software and can be expensive so please consider this when choosing your desired workflow but also consider that this is a complete workflow right up to importing your video file into Filmora so the price may be justified compared to multiple software. Another thing to consider is you can mostly get the desired results you want without the use of a drawing tablet cutting even more cost.</p><h2 id="3DCoat-2022"><a href="#3DCoat-2022" class="headerlink" title="3DCoat 2022"></a>3DCoat 2022</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3-coat-2022.jpg"                      alt="3 coat 2022"                ></p><p>3DCoat was first released in 2007 and has released constant updates inline with the 3D art community needs. Being a smaller team of developers it’s quite impressive what they have achieved as this is a fully featured 3D art software capable of creating very nice detailed models. When used with the likes of Daz 3D, Keyshot or similar animation software you can easily create the animation you are planning. This is not a full workflow but it is very close to one and the team are constantly releasing updates so one day it might be. You have the ability to UV your models as well as texture, paint and sculpt all within one program and this has one of the most impressive live retopo tools around called voxel modeling mode. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Easy texturing and PBR with the use of smart materials and a HDRL viewport.</li><li>Voxel sculpting with complex boolean operations and adaptive dynamic tessellation.</li><li>Classic polygonal modeling is fully supported and also supports splines and joints.</li><li>Auto-retopology with user-defined edge loops but also fast and easy manual tools.</li><li>Professional tools for creating and editing UV-sets.</li><li>Native global uniform unwrapping algorithms.</li><li>PBR and HDRL rendering for concept exporting.</li><li>Use of scripts for repetitive actions.</li><li>And many more.</li></ul><p>This is paid software but with many options to buy as well as unlimited learning period which you will have to take into consideration when you are deciding to take this in your workflow. And again another consideration is your hardware and 3DCoat is complex due to the complexity of their software , as a point of reference there website states they consider a Surface Pro as the minimal hardware needed to use there software, minimum system specs are as follows:</p><ul><li>64-Bit Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11, macOS 10.13 High Sierra or higher, Linux Ubuntu 20.04+</li><li>CPU m3 1.00 GHz,</li><li>4GB RAM</li><li>Intel HD Graphics 615</li><li>This will allow painting textures up to 2K and sculpting up to 1 million triangles</li></ul><p>What makes 3DCoat a good choice is the fact they have unlimited learning allowing you to journey into sculpting without putting any money in to start and in confection with other software it is very powerful.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139110/17108" target="_top" id="2139110">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139110" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139110/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Blender"><a href="#Blender" class="headerlink" title="Blender"></a>Blender</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/blender-modeling-software.jpg"                      alt="blender modeling software"                ></p><p>So now it’s time to talk about Blender, the Blender institute set off with one main goal in mind and that was to put powerful tools for use with 3D and CG in the hands of artists in the form of free&#x2F;open-source software. This is commendable and they have in large achieved what they set out to do, not only can you sculpt or model in Blender you can also rig and animate and add VFX to your projects.</p><p>It’s impressive to see what you can do with free software and you will be able to achieve very good results. What you miss out on in the form of automation tools and boutique brushes and toolsets this makes up for in an ever-expanding community driven tutorials and guides. With this being free it doesn’t make sense to not have this installed even if you have a different workflow due to the ability to expand with new skills that may work their way into your daily task. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Render with impressive results thanks to cycles,</li><li>An extensive toolset for modeling, curves and retopology</li><li>Sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility needed in several stages of production</li><li>Designed for animation in mind</li><li>Push the boundaries of story art by drawing in a 3d environment</li><li>Powerful post FX and VFX tools like object motion tracking</li><li>Fully customisable UI and controles</li><li>Python API means every tool can be customized and scripted</li></ul><p>Blender is complex software and due to this some functions require different hardware specs but as a rule the higher the CPU speed and cores plus the more RAM you have the more you can do at any given time. With this said the minimum system requirements are as follows@</p><ul><li>Windows 8.1,10 and 11, macOS 10.13 and above and Linux supported</li><li>64-Bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>Full HD display</li><li>Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet</li><li>Graphics card with 2GB VRAM, OpenGL 4.3 support</li></ul><p>Blender receives regular updates and is supported by community scripts and content and is becoming a new go to tool for 3D artists in all industries and backgrounds making it a real contender when picking a workflow.</p><p><strong>From Desktop to Portable</strong></p><p>There are lots of options and this list is in no way stating what you may already use is not good enough, this is just what is being used in the industry and is more accessible to a starter or someone who works from home and doesn’t want to spend thousands upfront for their software.</p><p>That being said there is more than just the desktop workflow and some people lead busy lifestyles and are always on the move. This is where I would like to introduce the portable workflow. Due to the fact the Ipad Pro is considered a must have for portable creativity and with recent releases there has never been a better time to start i will be showing Ipad compatible apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975658">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975658">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975658%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975658/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Forger-by-Maxon"><a href="#Forger-by-Maxon" class="headerlink" title="Forger by Maxon"></a>Forger by Maxon</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/forger-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="forger by maxon"                ></p><p>Forger is released as a standalone app or part of the Maxon one. Forger gives you all the tools needed to create sculptures and models on the go which you can be proud of. Designed by artists for artists the features are quite large considering this is running on an ipad and with the seamlessness of importing and exporting to and from software such as cinema 4D this can be worked into your workflow very easily. One feature of Forger that people like to talk about is the ability to use your ipad camera and view your model in the real world using augmented reality.</p><p>Some of the key features of Forger but not limited to are as follows:</p><ul><li>Multi-resolution mesh sculpting via catmull0clark mesh subdivisions.</li><li>Volume-based quad-dominant remeshing.</li><li>Sculpt in layers.</li><li>Sculpt with a mask with the ability to clear, invert, blur, grow and shrink your masks.</li><li>Ability to close holes in existing meshes</li><li>Simple auto-generation of mesh UVs.</li><li>Symmetrical sculpting based on axis of choice</li><li>Ability to reapply symmetry to topologically symmetrical meshes.</li></ul><p>Forger is very powerful and don’t let the fact it’s on an ipad make you think it’s inferior to the bigger desktop software as this is very capable of getting the results you are looking for. It just takes a bit of researching and a different learning curve. Due to the fact it is on an ipad the system requirements are easier to achieve, minimum system requirements are as follows</p><ul><li>IOS 15 or later</li><li>Ipad pro or current model ipad</li></ul><p>A note from the developers, the more complex the model being sculpted, the more RAM required. While there is no screen size requirement, as anticipated the bigger the better when it comes to sculpting workspace.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118315/7443" target="_top" id="2118315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118315/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Nomad-Sculpt"><a href="#Nomad-Sculpt" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Sculpt"></a>Nomad Sculpt</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/nomad-sculpt-software.jpg"                      alt="nomad sculpt software"                ></p><p>Nomad Sculpt is another contender offering powerful tools that artists can use to sculpt outstanding models for your animations. With a fixed price payment once you buy this you get regular updates and added features meaning you can buy with the confidence you will always have the best tools available. Nomad has a growing community of tutors giving guides and tutorials to get your desired results so no matter your experience Nomad is accessible to you.

According to most users, the built-in image viewer is not top of the list. As you keep reading, you will discover why Windows 10 Photos is not a good choice. In addition, you will find recommendations for fast image viewer Windows 10 and why they outrank the proprietary software. Finally, remember that the list contains free and paid programs you can use for your creative work.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">PhotoDirector 365</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">XnView Classic</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">IrfanView Graphic Viewer</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">WidsMob Viewer Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Image Glass</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Free Video Editor to Make Slideshow with Photos</a></li><li><a href="#part4">FAQs</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice"><a href="#Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?"></a>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Horrible user experience"></a><strong>4. Horrible user experience</strong></h4><p>How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds. Unfortunately, using image viewer Windows 10 is a completely different ball game.?</p><p>First, you have to save a copy of your photo. Then, find the duplicate and then upload it to One Drive. What a nightmare!</p><h2 id="Part2-Top-Best-Fast-Photo-Viewer-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Part2-Top-Best-Fast-Photo-Viewer-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10"></a>Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10</h2><p>There are several more reasons why you should not use photo viewer for Windows 10.

Then, change your preferred app by selecting it from the <strong>Photos</strong> menu.</p><p>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow-1"><a href="#1-It-is-slow-1" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore-1"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience-1"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4. Create an Exit Animation</em></strong></p><p>You can then close the animation loop by designing an exit animation. Here’s how to do it;</p><p>Step1 Select all the layers that you have created so far and then go to “Layers &gt; Pre-compose.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-on-exit-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="create on exit animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Move the playhead to about 3 seconds and then click on “Edit” and select “Split Layer.” Delete the top Split Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/delete-the-top-split-layer.jpg"                      alt="delete the top split layer"                ></p><p>Step3 Select the comp that is remaining and click on “Edit” to select “Duplicate.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-duplicate-ae.jpg"                      alt="edit duplicate ae"                ></p><p>Step4 Right-click on the duplicated layer and choose “Time” to select “Time Reverse Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/time-reverse-layer-ae.jpg"                      alt="time reverse layer ae"                ></p><p>Step5 Move the duplicated layers to the right until you find that there are no gaps between the two layers.</p><p><strong><em>5. Add Color to the Animation</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add color to the animation to make it stand out a little bit more, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Create a new composition to create new text or if you already have text on your screen, go to Window &gt; Align and select an alignment that fits into your project.</p><p>Step2 Then click on “Effects” select “Gradient Ramp” and add the effect next to the text later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-color-to-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="add color to animation ae"                ></p><p>Step3 Move the points on the screen to change the intensity and direction of the gradient as desired.</p><p>Step4 You can then use the “Effects Window” to change the color as desired.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Best-Free-After-Effects-Title-Templates-1"><a href="#Best-Free-After-Effects-Title-Templates-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Free After Effects Title Templates"></a>Best Free After Effects Title Templates</h2><p>The following are just some of the best After Effects title templates to choose from;</p><h3 id="1-Future-Action-After-Effects-Title-Template-1"><a href="#1-Future-Action-After-Effects-Title-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4.
