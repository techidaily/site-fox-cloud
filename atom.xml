The FAA predicts that by the year 2020, a massive seven million drones could be sold in the U.S. alone; that’s about two and a half times the entire population of Nevada!</p><p>When it comes to buying a drone, the undisputed drone king right now is, without a doubt, Chinese company <a class="link"   href="https://www.dji.com/" >DJI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Having achieved amazing success with the highly portable Mavic Pro in 2016, and with the pocket rocket DJI Spark last year, the world held its breath to see what was coming next.</p><p>What did come next was something truly amazing; perhaps a real game changer. Neatly squeezing in the middle of their two highly successful products came the brand-new Mavic Air; a quadcopter that is highly portable, incredibly powerful and, dare we say it, a little bit sexier than its predecessors. But does it live up to the promise, and how does it compare with the amazingly popular, entry level DJI Spark?</p><p>If you’re looking for easy portability, the DJI Spark is smaller and lighter but can’t be folded. When you collapse the arms on the Mavic Air, it’s compact and easy to stow, making it far more transportable than many of its predecessors.</p><p>If performance is key for you, it’s crucial to know that the Mavic Air will offer you a longer flight time by a substantial five minutes and is also faster by around 18.4km per hour, compared to the Spark. In addition to this, the range of the Mavic Air is a massive 50 per cent further than the Spark, at a huge 4km compared to 2km.</p><p>In terms of photographic capabilities, both drones offer some pretty good specs. However, the DJI Mavic Air outpaces the smaller Spark in terms of image quality, topping out at 100mbps compared to 24mbps and recording in up to 4K definition at 12MP. The Spark is configured to run at 1080p only. Both models offer obstacle avoidance and have numerous features, but on almost every specification, the Mavic Air seems to do just a little bit better.</p><p>So, is the more expensive DJI Mavic Air really worth the extra investment? With a price tag in the region of $400 to $700 more than that of the Spark packages, it’s a question well worth considering.

Most of the headsets have the ability to track the user’s head movements so that the wherever the user looks, the character in the virtual reality also looks. If done in the right manner, the headsets give an impression of the user being actually inside the game or the movie, hence the name “virtual reality”.</p><h2 id="How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work"><a href="#How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Virtual Reality headsets work"></a>How does Virtual Reality headsets work</h2><p> The principle goal of the virtual reality headsets is to create life-size, 3D virtual environments with no boundaries like those associated with computer or television screens. In case of the Rift or HTC’s Vive, video is sent from the computer or the console to the headset through a HDMI cable, while for the Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, the videos are already on the smartphone mounted on the headsets.</p><p> The VR headsets may use a single feed or two feeds sent directly to either one or two LCD displays, one for each eye. There are also a set of lenses placed between the user’s eyes and the pixels and this is the reason why the devices are sometimes referred to as goggles. In some cases, the lenses can be adjusted to match the distance between the eyes and this distance will also vary from one user to another.</p><p> The lenses will focus and reshape the images for each eye before creating a stereoscopic 3D image by positioning the 2D images to portray how each of the two eyes see the world. One way in which the virtual reality headsets increases immersion is by increasing the field of view or simply how wide a picture appears. A 360 degrees display may not be convenient and most of the high end VR headsets usually use 100 or 110 degree field of views, which is usually sufficient enough to give the effects.</p><p> And for the final images to be totally convincing, the VR headsets use minimum frame rates of 60fps to do away with shuttering or make the users feel sick.</p><h2 id="Top-VR-headsets-overview"><a href="#Top-VR-headsets-overview" class="headerlink" title="Top VR headsets overview"></a>Top VR headsets overview</h2><p> The race by tech giants to get their share of the virtual reality market is on and company after company is burning the midnight oil to produce the next best headset.</p><p> Below is a list of the various VR headsets currently available to purchase:</p><h3 id="HTC-Vive"><a href="#HTC-Vive" class="headerlink" title="HTC Vive"></a>HTC Vive</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/htc-vive.png"                      alt="ghtc-vive-vr"                ></p><p> HTC Vive VR headset is made in collaboration with Valve and it plugs directly into PCs and uses Valve’s humongous gaming ecosystem. The headset has over 70 sensors to allow for 360 degrees head tracking and it also boasts of a 90Hz refresh rate responsible for keeping down the latency, which in turn saves the users from suffering motions sickness. This headset is currently available for purchase from $799.</p><h3 id="Samsung-Gear-VR"><a href="#Samsung-Gear-VR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Gear VR"></a>Samsung Gear VR</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gear-vr.png"                      alt="gear-vr"                ></p><p> The Samsung Gear VR is essentially Oculus Rift lite, owing to the fact that the two companies worked on the technology together. The Gear VR uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone for the display and as the processor. The phone slots in front of the lenses and into a Micro USB slot, and uses the super AMOLED display as the screen. With the Gear, all you have to do is to slot in the phone, put on the headset and start enjoying the virtual reality experience.</p><h3 id="Oculus-Rift"><a href="#Oculus-Rift" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Rift"></a>Oculus Rift</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oculus-rift.jpg"                      alt="oculus-rift"                ></p><p> Oculus Rift headset was responsible for the current hysteria in virtual reality. The Rift plugs into the computer’s USB and DVI ports and tracks the movements of the head to provide 3D displays on its stereo screens. The consumer edition of the Rift comes with a 2160 x 1200 resolution as well as a refresh rate of 90Hz. The Rift matches HTC Vive in terms of the refresh rate, but lags behind Sony’s PlayStation VR, though it is a pretty advanced VR headset in terms of the technology used.</p><h3 id="Sony-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Sony-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Sony PlayStation VR"></a>Sony PlayStation VR</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-playstation-vr.jpg"                      alt="sony-playstation-vr"                ></p><p> Sony has finally announced the launch date for the PlayStation VR headset and this is expected to be 13th October 2016. A new version though, was announced way back in 2015 and it featured a 5-inch LCD display of the original prototype. For the version to be released, it is expected to have a 5.7 inch OLED to allow for low persistence which will in turn translate to less motion blur. The refresh rate for Sony’s PlayStation VR has been ramped up to 120Hz, making it possible to have 120fps gaming.</p><h3 id="Google-Cardboard"><a href="#Google-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="Google Cardboard"></a>Google Cardboard</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-cardboard-vr.jpg"                      alt="google-cardboard-vr"                ></p><p> Not to be left behind, Google also has a cardboard virtual reality headset. With this headset, it sounds like popping your smartphone in a cardboard container and putting it over your head for a virtual reality experience. Sounds like a joke, but you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that it works like charm and it is also low cost. If anything, the smartphone you have already has all the gyroscopic sensors as well as the positioning devices needed to track your head movements.</p><p> Since the Cardboard has grown so much in terms of popularity, Google has planned to release a better version known as Daydream. This will be a device like the Gear VR, but it has been designed to work with android phones which are currently being revamped to over better VR experiences. It is still not know when the new device will be available, but the Cardboard is retailing at $16.99 at Amazon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-meet-the-system-and-hardware-needs-of-big-sur-os-for-2024/"><u>[New] Meet the System & Hardware Needs of Big Sur OS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/voice-only-visionaries-vs-youtube-enthusiasts/"><u>Voice-Only Visionaries Vs.

Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, <strong>can you speed up Facebook videos</strong> still?</p><p>The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let’s discuss the <strong>Facebook video speed controller</strong> options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="add an extension for increasing video speed"                ></p><h2 id="The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook"></a>The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook</h2><p>Multiple suitable solutions are available for users to try changing the Facebook videos they watch or play. One major reason to <strong>speed up Facebook videos</strong> for people is the typical size of this content.

In this case, external solutions are useful, like the <strong>Video Speed Controller Facebook</strong> extension, Fast Playback, or third-party apps.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Using-Browser-Extensions-to-Speed-Up-Facebook-Video"><a href="#Part-I-Using-Browser-Extensions-to-Speed-Up-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part I.

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

Many editors add slow-motion effects to videos or parts to create a stylish and top-notch look.</p><p>However, this effect becomes a default in the videos after adding it, and users cannot easily deactivate the setting. It can get annoying to deal with when you are trying to play a video, but it starts automatically playing in slow-motion on your video player. Thus, for most users, learning <strong>how to change slow-motion video to normal-speed Android</strong> is important.</p><p>In general, there is no built-in feature that allows Android users to change recorded video speed, like reversing slow motion. So, it would be best if you considered third-party tools in this case. Multiple options are usable in this context, and we explain some of the best ones here. Interested?

Multiple apps come with varying speed range choices and speed ramping support.</p><p>It would help if you tried them all out before settling on the best one suited for your needs.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlined-process-for-shaping-photos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Streamlined Process for Shaping Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-fundamental-concepts-of-cyber-narratives/"><u>[New] Fundamental Concepts of Cyber Narratives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/in-2024-enthralling-examination-and-replacement-ideas/"><u>In 2024, Enthralling Examination & Replacement Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-advice-on-tailoring-game-sounds-to-stand-out-in-the-virtual-arena-of-free-fire/"><u>In 2024, Expert Advice on Tailoring Game Sounds to Stand Out in the Virtual Arena of Free Fire</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-retro-smile-captured-by-iphone-x-classic/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Retro Smile Captured by iPhone X Classic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-craft-your-podcasts-identity-with-ai-name-generators/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Craft Your Podcast's Identity with AI Name Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-duel-of-the-camcorders-gopros-black-versus-sony-fdr-x1000v/"><u>2024 Approved  Duel of the Camcorders  GoPro's Black Versus Sony FDR-X1000V</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-soundtrack-switch-up-effortlessly-moving-your-music-queue/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Soundtrack Switch-Up  Effortlessly Moving Your Music Queue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-top-9-windows-gif-capture-tools-perfect-animation-preservation/"><u>[Updated] Top 9 Windows GIF Capture Tools  Perfect Animation Preservation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/how-to-record-a-podcast-on-iphone-or-ipad-best-for-interviews-and-trave/"><u>How To Record a Podcast on iPhone or iPad (Best for Interviews & Trave</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-srgb-and-traditional-rgb-rendering/"><u>2024 Approved  Srgb and Traditional Rgb Rendering</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-breaking-down-instagrams-standard-video-cap-solutions/"><u>In 2024, Breaking Down Instagram's Standard Video Cap  Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-access-your-apple-iphone-13-mini-when-you-forget-the-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Access Your Apple iPhone 13 mini When You Forget the Passcode? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-workable-fixes-to-the-sim-not-provisioned-mm2-error-on-nokia-c12-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Workable Fixes to the SIM not provisioned MM#2 Error on Nokia C12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevating-your-macs-tiktok-opener-quality/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Elevating Your Mac's TikTok Opener Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-multimedia-educational-show-key-insights-demystified/"><u>Updated Multimedia Educational Show Key Insights Demystified</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-novice-to-pro-youtube-to-mp3-converter-reviews-and-tutorials/"><u>Updated In 2024, From Novice to Pro YouTube to MP3 Converter Reviews and Tutorials</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Twitch-vs-YouTube-An-In-Depth-Comparative-Analysis"><a href="#Twitch-vs-YouTube-An-In-Depth-Comparative-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Twitch vs YouTube: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis"></a>Twitch vs YouTube: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis</h2><p>In recent years, the popularity of streaming content has exploded. This is due to the launch of platforms like Twitch and Youtube, which have made it easier for content creators&#x2F;streamers to reach a wide audience. But how do these two platforms differ?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a comprehensive look at <strong>Twitch vs. Youtube</strong> by comparing their browsing, content rule leniency, growth, and monetization. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of which platform is right for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-vs-youtube.jpg"                      alt="twitch vs youtube"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube"></a>Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube</h2><p>Though Twitch and YouTube share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two:</p><p><strong>Browsing:</strong> Twitch and YouTube are search engines, but they differ in how they recommend videos to viewers. Twitch focuses on more popular streamers and doesn’t let users edit their thumbnails, while YouTube makes it easier for newbies to be found with a customizable thumbnail feature.</p><p><strong>Content Rule Leniency:</strong> Twitch and YouTube’s content guidelines are slightly different. YouTube is more easygoing when it comes to what videos can be posted. On the other hand, Twitch has a reputation for banning streamers without any justification. Even streamers with contracts seem to be treated the same as anyone else when this happens.</p><p><strong>Growth:</strong> YouTube offers more advantages over Twitch in terms of growth as it is more accessible and has a better algorithm that allows small content creators to grow their channels quickly. However, Twitch mainly focuses on popular content streamers and offers fewer growth opportunities for newbies.</p><p><strong>Monetization:</strong> When it comes to monetization, both platforms offer different options for content creators. On Twitch, content creators can earn revenue from subscriptions, sponsored advertisements, donations, affiliate programs, merchandise sales, etc. On YouTube, content creators can earn revenue from direct advertisements, sponsorships, partnership programs, streams, donations, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="youtube monetization"                ></p><p><strong>Chat and Moderation Policies:</strong> Twitch uses a time-based strict chat moderation policy and does not have the pause or rewind option. While on YouTube, the chat is arranged based on relevance and comes with only standard emojis for visual presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Comparison of Two Important Features Between Twitch and YOUTUBE: Partnership and Gaming"></a>Part 2. Comparison of Two Important Features Between Twitch and YOUTUBE: Partnership and Gaming</h2><h3 id="YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership"><a href="#YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership" class="headerlink" title="YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership"></a>YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership</h3><p>Affiliate programs are accessible on both Twitch and YouTube with specific requirements that you need to adhere to. These include a consistent uploading or streaming schedule, viewer engagement on your content, certain watch times, and the required number of subscribers on your channel.</p><p>Unlike YouTube, Twitch offers both affiliate and partnership programs.

Over the past few years, two of the biggest platforms for streaming gaming content have been Twitch and YouTube. So which platform is worth using? Let’s find out!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-gaming.jpg"                      alt="twitch gaming"                ></p><p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Twitch algorithm is mainly based on the number of viewers on your videos. Moreover, when browsing, it mainly suggests only the popular streamers with a strong subscriber base.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube is owned by Google and creates more opportunities for streamers to be found. Also, its search algorithm takes into account the number of likes, comments, and shares on your video.</p><p><strong>Streamer-Viewer Dynamics:</strong> On Twitch, viewers often get more involved with the streamer as opposed to YouTube gaming viewers, who prefer to watch videos without commentary.</p><p><strong>Engagement Requirements For Streamers:</strong> To grow on YouTube, you need at least 4000 hours of watch time and a good number of likes, shares, and comments on your video. While on Twitch, you need at least a 20-30% engagement rate and a large number of subscribers.</p><p><strong>Competition Level Of Streamer:</strong> YouTube has fewer streamers but a 20 times more extensive user base. The potential for growth for new streamers is much higher due to the lower competition on the platform. Additionally, the platform provides more prominent exposure for new content creators.</p><h3 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h3><p>Twitch is a better streaming platform if you want to cultivate a following around your content. Although creating your followers’ community at first can be difficult, it largely depends on how engaging and compelling your content is.</p><p>As a new content creator or a streamer to create and upload pre-recorded videos, YouTube is a better choice for you. Make sure to upload the most enthralling games to keep your audience captivating and interested.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More"><a href="#Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?"></a>Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?</h2><p>The amount of revenue you can make on Twitch or YouTube is directly related to your follower base. The higher the number of followers&#x2F;viewers, the more you will earn. Here’s how each platform pays its streamers.</p><h3 id="How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How Twitch Pay Their Streamers"></a>How Twitch Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>There are five ways in which you can make money while streaming your content on Twitch:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> You can turn on ads on your content when your stream gets the affiliate’s status. Ad revenues are based on the number of impressions (views) your content receives, and the average payout is $0.25 - $1.50 per 1,000 views.</p><p><strong>Bits</strong>: As a streamer on Twitch, you can also receive donations from your viewers in the form of a unique currency on the platform known as Bits. It’s important to note that Twitch takes a 29% cut-off of all donations made this way, leaving the streamer with 71% of the total donation. We have a complete guide to help you understand <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what Twitch Bits are and how to earn&#x2F;get them for free. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-bits.jpg"                      alt="twitch bits"                ></p><p><strong>Donations:</strong> Donations made through Paypal or other monetary exchange platforms benefit the streamer as they will receive 100% of the donation. This is the cheaper way of ensuring that the streamer gets the entire donation amount from the viewer.</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> Subscribers can support your channel by getting a subscription for a minimum of $4.99 per month. Twitch only takes 50% of subscription fees. This makes it much more profitable for streamers, as they can earn $2.50 per subscription per month.</p><p><strong>Merchandise:</strong> In terms of merchandise, Twitch has an advantage over YouTube because it comes with various merchandising extensions that can help you to make sales directly to your viewers during a live stream without the need for them to leave the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-monetization.jpg"                      alt="twitch monetization"                ></p><h3 id="How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Pay Their Streamers"></a>How YouTube Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>YouTube pays its streamers in three different ways:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> Once your channel reaches a specific threshold, you become eligible for displaying ads on your YouTube channel. YouTube ads pay more than Twitch. For each 1000 ad views, you will get $18, which means you can earn up to $3 to $5 per 1k video views.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> YouTube members are equivalent to Twitch’s subscribers. YouTube pays 70% of membership fees to the creators. The eligibility to offer channel memberships opens up at 30,000 subscribers for all types of channels, but for gaming channels, in particular, a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are required. Additionally, creators must also be a part of the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p><strong>Super Chat:</strong> Youtube pays streamers 70% of each super chat donation made on the platform and retains 30%. While this may seem to be expensive, it helps cover the costs of hosting a Livestream. Without this donation, Youtube would not be able to function as smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-super-chat.jpg"                      alt="youtube super chat"                ></p><h3 id="Which-Pays-More"><a href="#Which-Pays-More" class="headerlink" title="Which Pays More?"></a>Which Pays More?</h3><p>Due to the lower threshold for monetization, Twitch pays more to the new content creators and offers more monetization options. However, it is difficult to grow on Twitch compared to YouTube, which has a stronger user base.</p><p>YouTube is easier to generate income in the long run as you can upload recorded gaming videos which can get more viewers as it is always available on the platform. Moreover, you can also make more from YouTube ads than on Twitch.</p><p><strong>Video - Where Should You Stream in 2022? - Twitch vs YouTube Live</strong></p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?"></a>How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?</h3><p>On YouTube, a streamer mainly gets paid based on the ads, which is $0.10 to $0.30 per ad view.

Well, who wouldn’t want to make use of its high quality camera and powerful functionalities to capture the most alluring view! Nevertheless, most of the people fail to take better photos since they don’t know some key photography rules. If you are one of those, all you need to have is little more knowledge on photography composition rules. In today’s post, we have collated 10 golden photography rules that will empower you to steal the view perfectly with your iPhone. So let’s explore and make your photos even more stunning.</p><h2 id="Rule-of-Thirds"><a href="#Rule-of-Thirds" class="headerlink" title="Rule of Thirds"></a>Rule of Thirds</h2><p> The Rule of Thirds consists of a set of guidelines to assist a photographer correctly position the subject in a particular scene. It is meant to draw the attention of the viewer directly towards the subject. According to this rule, the picture is divided into nine equal grids that break the entire image with two vertical and two horizontal lines into vertical and horizontal thirds. As per the Rule of Thirds, the subject should be placed at the intersecting points of the grids.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rule-of-third.jpg"                      alt="rule of third"                ></p><h2 id="Leading-Lines"><a href="#Leading-Lines" class="headerlink" title="Leading Lines"></a>Leading Lines</h2><p> Leading lines add depth and scale to an image by leading the eyes into an image. When you want to capture a road running between two rows of trees, a suspended wooden bridge vanishing at a distant point, leading lines make sure that the picture is taken in such a way that the viewer’s eyes would follow your direction (here, the way you guide them along the rows of trees or the bridge vanishing in the horizon). Leading lines create a great impact on the photographs that you click with your iPhone and don’t let the observer wander away from your subject. The leading lines can be diagonal, straight, zigzag, curvy, or radial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/leading-lines.jpg"                      alt="leading lines"                ></p><h2 id="Symmetry"><a href="#Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="Symmetry"></a>Symmetry</h2><p> For the perfect photo composition with an iPhone, one should understand what all make for the right composition. Photographers divide the frame they want to click into rough patterns and position the subject at the right place to get wonderful shots. Both man-made and natural symmetry and patterns represent eye-catching compositions. You can either take a shot following the symmetric patterns or break them to make the subject stand out by adding focal points and tension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Symmetrical.jpg"                      alt="symmetrical"                ></p><h2 id="Framing"><a href="#Framing" class="headerlink" title="Framing"></a>Framing</h2><p> When we see a framed photograph, the frame brings out the beauty of the photograph. There are natural and man-made frames lying around. You just need to find that while clicking a picture. Framing the subject with such frames amplifies focus towards it, by isolating it from the world around. You can capture your subject through a hole, an arch, and different shapes and structures that you can visualize at that time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/framing.jpg"                      alt="framing"                ></p><h2 id="Diagonals"><a href="#Diagonals" class="headerlink" title="Diagonals"></a>Diagonals</h2><p> Diagonals are an integral aspect of photography composition, as they determine the outcome of a picture you have clicked using your iPhone. Let’s get to know what the role of diagonals in a picture is and how it impacts the visual. As you know the Rules of Thirds is important and it positions the subject of interest at a corner over the grid outlay of a photograph. It sometimes might leave the other corner empty and unbalance the image. Using diagonals, you can position the main subject and diagonally move the less important subjects towards the other end to click the perfectly balanced shot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/diagonal.jpg"                      alt="diagonal"                ></p><h2 id="Shape"><a href="#Shape" class="headerlink" title="Shape"></a>Shape</h2><p> Speaking of shape in photography composition sounds odd? ‘Rule of Thirds’ and ‘Leading Lines’ are not the only rules that make a photo composition. Line, shape, texture, form, space, color, and pattern also play a key role to make your iPhone photography a real treasure. Shape defines the two dimensional view of the subject and the entire scene as well. A well defined subject with a silhouette and backlighting or a black and white picture looks more appealing than a color picture where the shape of the subject or other objects is not prominent. Forms and shapes play an integral role in photography.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shape.jpg"                      alt="shape"                ></p><h2 id="Leave-Empty-Space"><a href="#Leave-Empty-Space" class="headerlink" title="Leave Empty Space"></a>Leave Empty Space</h2><p> You may wonder if I leave too much empty space in my photo contradicts the concept of ‘filling the frame’. But, it brings out the best for your iPhone photography when you have a strong subject in your scene. A clutter free and less distractive environment leads the viewers’ focus towards the main subject. You can think of clicking a giant statue against a clear blue sky, where the sky would act as a perfect background for the statue and render a clean look to the empty space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Space.jpg"                      alt="space"                ></p><h2 id="The-Direction-of-Subject"><a href="#The-Direction-of-Subject" class="headerlink" title="The Direction of Subject"></a>The Direction of Subject</h2><p> Like all the photography composition rules, it is important to take note of the direction of the subject in a photograph. This is known as the ‘Rule of Space’ and it leads the viewer towards the subject’s direction of motion. For example, if there is a person walking on the road, then there should be space ahead of him. If there is a person sitting in a bench or rock, he should be clicked facing into the frame, and there should be space in front of him. It will help the viewer’s eyes to go along with the direction he is facing and take notice of the other subjects such as, other people walking in front him, or any pet moving around etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/direction.jpg"                      alt="direction"                ></p><h2 id="Fill-Your-Frame"><a href="#Fill-Your-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill Your Frame"></a>Fill Your Frame</h2><p> Making your subject stand out against the entire frame in a photograph creates more impact. You can easily obtain this goal with your iPhone by covering the entire frame with your subject. According to this amazing photography composition technique, all you have to do is move your iPhone closer to the subject and nullify the appearance of the surroundings to take a close shot. Like this, you are able to capture the intricate detailing of a leaf with its vivid colors and texture, the detailing and motif on a wall art and much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-the-screen.jpg"                      alt="fill the screen"                ></p><h2 id="Break-the-Rules"><a href="#Break-the-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Break the Rules"></a>Break the Rules</h2><p> Lastly, we would say that forget and break all the rules. Make use of the above mentioned rules in photography, but don’t let your heart stick to it. Explore, experiment and let your imaginations fly high to capture whatever you want and however you can that fills your soul. Photography is a passion and you must enjoy it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/break.jpg"                      alt="breal the rules"                ></p><h2 id="Conclsion"><a href="#Conclsion" class="headerlink" title="Conclsion"></a>Conclsion</h2><p> Next time you are out to shoot something with your iPhone, try these photo composition rules and click mind blowing pictures. Though, these rules help you to get amazing iPhone pictures, learning to find the right subject and clicking with the right photo composition helps you more. With or without the rules, you have to keep a steady hand and a sharp eye for detail with patience if you want to click beautiful photographs with your iPhone.</p><p> Images come from the Internet</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-effective-system-to-integrate-gopro-video-into-fully-rotational-cinematic-pieces/"><u>[New] Effective System to Integrate GoPro Video Into Fully Rotational Cinematic Pieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-acknowledgement-roundup-free-and-paid-template-haven/"><u>[New] Acknowledgement Roundup  Free & Paid Template Haven</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-unmatched-video-upload-aides-to-twitter/"><u>[Updated] Unmatched Video Upload Aides to Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/unlock-movie-magic-with-cg-centrals-look-up-tables-luts/"><u>Unlock Movie Magic with CG Central's Look-Up Tables (Luts)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-lgs-visionary-pursuit-deep-insights-into-the-31mu97-b-monitor-review-for-2024/"><u>[New] LG's Visionary Pursuit  Deep Insights Into the 31MU97-B Monitor Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-next-gen-patient-rehabilitation-tools-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Next-Gen Patient Rehabilitation Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-lg-monitor-in-depth-analysis-and-user-feedback-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] LG Monitor  In-Depth Analysis and User Feedback for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/sim-unlock-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Sim Unlock Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Phones without Code 2 Ways to Remove Android Sim Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-expediting-fb-videos-leading-extensions-and-apps-compilation/"><u>[New] Expediting FB Videos  Leading Extensions & Apps Compilation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/newbies-navigation-to-net-worth-on-periscope/"><u>Newbie's Navigation to Net Worth on Periscope</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/visionsplit-assessment-overview-for-2024/"><u>VisionSplit Assessment Overview for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-record-on-garageband-a-complete-guideline/"><u>New 2024 Approved How to Record on GarageBand?

The top portion of this player is designed with a metal sheet that provide a nice texture but rest of the body is coated with simple black plastic material , it may appear tacky to most of users.</p><p> Although, Panasonic DMP-UB900 is also designed with black plastic coating but it possesses an eye catching mirrored finish. Further, you will not be able to find any display on this device and it indicates everything via LEDs. As there is no screen to let your know about loading speed and other activities so you can simply keep on waiting with frustration. Backside of UBD-K8500 consists of few essential plugs like twin HDMI sockets, digital optical output, Ethernet and power.</p><p> Remote control of this Samsung player is compact and easy to handle with direction keys and a central select button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/k8500-1.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Connections-and-Control"><a href="#Connections-and-Control" class="headerlink" title="Connections and Control"></a>Connections and Control</h2><p> Samsung UBD-K8500 is designed with sleek appearance having slight curve on rear as well as front portion. The black brushed metal finish make its design pretty good whereas body is actually designed with metal so you may find it highly durable. This player offers reasonably silent operation but you may find that disc tray little noisy and you can clearly feel its motion while moving in and out. A fan is available at rear portion of player that also makes audible noise. The overall weight of UBD-K8500 is 1.9 Kg with total dimension of 406x45x230mm.</p><p> The front side of player consists of an angled lip whereas the right portion possesses a touch sensitive type power, play&#x2F;pause, stop and eject button. The LED indicators will help to indicate the power On function. It doesn’t consist of a display screen on front side but it is not a drawback rather it helps users to enjoy better view in darker rooms. In case if you need any information about current playback then you simply need to press the info button available on remote control; as soon as you press, all details will be displayed on screen. The middle section of device contains a USB port and on left side you will avail a disc tray.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/k8500-2.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p> The most important feature of UBD-K8500 is its picture quality for 4K Blu-ray player. If we talk about the fine details then its colour information is stunning enough while native 4K disc edge offers fast Amazon and Netflix connectivity. The 4K HDR ability re-writes the AV setup options so one cannot use traditional test patterns for its image balancing while viewing HDR content. The best trick is to navigate as per player modes as it consists of a coupled HDR input mode that ensures perfect integrity of HDR signal.</p><p> There are numbers of picture modes within tools menu as like User, Movie, Standard and Dynamic. Most of the users may think about Movie mode as their first preference for quality results but the tests show that lots of important audio information is lost during this mode. In case of standard settings, you will be able to avail better subtitle detailing however, contrast and brightness options are equally good in Movie mode. In simple words, selection of right mode highly depends upon user needs and options to make compromises.</p><p> Now, here is one important thing to note that if you try to watch standard blu-ray content with same HDMI input and same content settings then image will naturally get degraded. This happens due to unwanted scaling of image. The best way to get your desired output level is to make adjustments for user settings of this player. It will help you to develop better results for 1080p Blu-ray content but note that switching between viewing modes like this will become complicated if you are not able to remember right disc formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/k8500-3.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p> In simple words, Samsung UBD-K8500 is one of the best devices for your Ultra HD TV needs.
