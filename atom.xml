There are numerous features available on WhatsApp. However, today we will discuss an essential topic regarding WhatsApp: <strong>how you can send a voice message or recorded audio on WhatsApp</strong>. This guide will briefly examine the methods of <strong>sending voice messages</strong> and <strong>audio recording</strong> over WhatsApp on iOS or Android.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-send-a-voice-message-on-WhatsApp"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-send-a-voice-message-on-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How to send a voice message on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Now let’s first look into how you can record and send a voice message on WhatsApp. We will discuss it from the perspective of both iOS and Android users.</p><h3 id="How-to-send-the-voice-message-on-iOS-or-Android"><a href="#How-to-send-the-voice-message-on-iOS-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to send the voice message on iOS or Android"></a>How to send the voice message on iOS or Android</h3><p>The steps of recording and sending a voice message using WhatsApp are nearly identical on iOS and Android devices. So both iOS and Android users can follow up on these steps:</p><ol><li>Press and hold the voice recorder button on the right side to record the voice message. However, a more effective way is to swipe up the voice recorder button to lock it. Now you can easily record it without holding the button.</li><li>There are three more options appear at the bottom:</li></ol><ul><li><strong>The Delete button</strong> can used to delete the voice you’ve just recorded. However, if you haven’t locked the recorder button, you can delete the message by sliding it to the left.</li><li><strong>The pause button</strong> can help you in pausing the recording.</li><li><strong>The send button</strong> will send your recorded voice message.</li></ul><ol><li>Before sending, you can also check your recorded voice by clicking the pause button, and then you have the option to play the voice.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/whatsapp-voice-messages-1.jpg"                      alt="clicking the pause button"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/whatsapp-voice-messages-2.jpg"                      alt="play the voice"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-send-recorded-audio-on-WhatsApp"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-send-recorded-audio-on-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="IOS-Meets-Android-An-In-Depth-Look-at-Facial-Tech"><a href="#IOS-Meets-Android-An-In-Depth-Look-at-Facial-Tech" class="headerlink" title="IOS Meets Android: An In-Depth Look at Facial Tech"></a>IOS Meets Android: An In-Depth Look at Facial Tech</h2><h1 id="Differences-between-iPhone-X-Face-ID-and-Samsung-Face-Recognition"><a href="#Differences-between-iPhone-X-Face-ID-and-Samsung-Face-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Differences between iPhone X Face ID and Samsung Face Recognition"></a>Differences between iPhone X Face ID and Samsung Face Recognition</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> With the launch of iPhone X, Apple has proved why people were crazy about the release. One of the most talked about features includes <strong>iPhone X Face ID</strong> security option which helps in unlocking the device with just recognizing the user’s face. However, Android has also introduced this sort of security lock with <strong>Samsung’s face recognition</strong>. Both the companies are remarkable with their own enhancement and technologies and claims to be the best for this face recognition technology. We therefore have appeared here with a thorough analysis of both devices’ face recognition capability. Let’s master what’s the difference between both.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How does it work?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: The Common Inconvenience</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Safety Issue</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-does-it-work"><a href="#Part-1-How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How does it work?"></a>Part 1: How does it work?</h2><p> This section will cover how the face recognition technology works for both the devices. Check out the process.</p><p> iPhone X:</p><p> While talking about latest iPhone, the company has designed the face detection function with a range of advanced sensors which include dot projector, infrared camera flood illuminator etc. The first component holds the capability to scrutinize the user’s face using TrueDepth camera. The camera captures in-depth face via more than 30,000 invisible dots in order to get the accurate and distinctive 3D facial map. This way, any kind of movement of your face will not stop the device to detect it before unlocking. When the dot pattern completes, the Infrared camera takes an infrared photo of the face. Once this gets done, an A11 Bionic chip’s neural engine helps in transforming the detailing and infrared face for meticulous precisions and confirming the enrolled face by comparing all the corrections. The A11 chip comes with full protection and is protected with secure Enclave.</p><p> The flood illuminator aims at infrared flash for enabling the face recognition technology to detect the face no matter what the surrounding light is. Putting differently, your face can be recognized even in dim light since your face is been recorded through infrared light.</p><p> Samsung:</p><p> Samsung also uses almost identical operation and involves two components which are IR LED and Iris camera. The former can be said as similar to the flood illuminator of the newest iPhone. IR LED works same as flood illuminator. It however shows difference only by focusing the infrared light on the eyes unlike flood illuminator which focus on the entire face. The Iris camera is nothing but infrared camera whose job is to take the picture of your iris. The process begins with IR LED which assists Iris camera by illuminating the eyes so that the camera gets the opportunity to capture the iris pattern properly. Samsung has the option to choose between both iris scanning or just one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Face-Unlock.jpg"                      alt="Samsung"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Which-one-is-more-Accuracy"><a href="#Part-2-Which-one-is-more-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?"></a>Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?</h2><p> Being accurate is a considerable issue with face recognition technology if you are using a Samsung device. On the other hand, iPhone X shows accuracy than Samsung since it analyzes the whole face instead of iris. For Samsung’s iris scanner, the camera contains a confined and narrowly designed focus where is exactly your iris needed to be for scanning. The camera will able to recognize only when your iris will be in that same place for long where it focuses. And therefore, there are times when you left with holding your device high for better iris detection. Apple has no such accuracy issue for it takes your face to recognize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-accuracy.jpg"                      alt="iPhone X accuracy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Common-Inconvenience"><a href="#Part-3-The-Common-Inconvenience" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The Common Inconvenience"></a>Part 3: The Common Inconvenience</h2><p> When it comes to practicality, we would state that both the phone don’t stand well for it. This is because if you use Apple’s latest invention i.e. iPhone X, you are required to first hold your device in your hand followed by looking at the screen. Then you need to swipe it up for unlocking the device.</p><p> On the other hand, when you are Samsung owner, you need to open your eyes accurately and stare the screen and the distance between the device and eyes ideally should be an arm length.</p><p> Both the devices need to be lifted to keep the face’s angle point accurately and it can look awkward when you need to use your device in a crowded place. Hence, both ways are kind of inconvenient to use especially when you wish to use your device secretly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/face-incovenience.jpg"                      alt="face ID incovenience"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Safety-Issue"><a href="#Part-4-Safety-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Safety Issue"></a>Part 4: Safety Issue</h2><p> Ensuring safety is one of the main concern people have and the face recognition technology in both the devices has done pretty well. Apple uses the TrueDepth camera system which includes flood illuminator, IR camera as well as dot projector to make the face recognized in all possible ways. It has been claimed by the company that the possibility of unlocking the device by a random person’s face is 1 in 1,000,000. Besides this, Apple had made sure to let people try only 5 face attempts after which they will require to enter the passcode. The probability though doesn’t work same for twins and the family members who resemble you. Also, the children who are less than 13 are able to trick you since they don’t have fully developed facial features.</p><p> Besides this, Apple has also made the newest model intelligent enough to not get fooled by any 2D photo or any other 2D mediums. Before releasing high-quality face recognition technology, Apple tested how the feature reacts with life-like masks and other techniques that can give rise to deceiving. To its surprise, the device got positive results and the Face ID has the ability to not get trapped by masks and the like things.</p><p> The Face ID by Apple in its iPhone X also makes itself proficient enough to detect the modifications in the appearances such as growing of beard or if a lady has applied makeup. Or if you have shaved your beard fully, the device takes a confirmation with the help of a passcode. What’s more, you don’t have to worry if you are wearing scarf or shades, cap, hat and even contact lenses, Face ID will work properly with the accessories too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/face-id-issue.jpg"                      alt="face ID issue"                ></p><p> On the other hand, Samsung also doesn’t lag behind when it comes to safety and security with face recognition feature. Samsung is the first Android device company to introduce face recognition technology that brought iris scanning technology with its Galaxy Note 7. The technology does it job by detecting the iris’ pattern of your eyes. As far as security is concerned, the technology gets 10 on 10 since each person possesses unique iris pattern and it becomes difficult to replicate. The devices by Samsung having face recognition technology are designed with infrared diode which is capable</p><p> All in all, both the companies have put extra effort in justifying the safety with trending face recognition technology. However, we are not certain for full reliability of them.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> The technology of facial recognition isn’t new to us and it has made people excited from the time it has come. However, many users have not started using the technology yet. We hope that this functionality will gain the popularity with time and people will start to make use of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-propeller-market-for-top-tier-fpv-drones/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating the Propeller Market for Top-Tier FPV Drones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mirth-manual-best-free-meme-kits-alive/"><u>2024 Approved  Mirth Manual  Best Free Meme Kits Alive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/become-a-whatsapp-pro-with-these-tricks-and-tips-for-2024/"><u>Become a WhatsApp Pro with These Tricks and Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/complete-guide-on-unlocking-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-with-a-broken-screen-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Complete Guide on Unlocking Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with a Broken Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/seamless-visuals-on-screen-zooming-into-clarity/"><u>Seamless Visuals on Screen  Zooming Into Clarity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-frequencies-fused-mac-studios-soundscapes/"><u>[New] In 2024, Frequencies Fused  Mac Studios Soundscapes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/10-best-hd-android-video-player-apps-you-should-know/"><u>10 Best Hd Android Video Player Apps You Should Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-the-videos-you-record-with-your-phone-often-dont-last-very-long-which-makes-it-a-bit-difficult-to-tell-the-entire-story-of-the-scene-you-captured-th/"><u>Updated The Videos You Record with Your Phone Often Dont Last Very Long, Which Makes It a Bit Difficult to Tell the Entire Story of the Scene You Captured.

Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2.

They are actually set of specially designed airfoils that radiates from some strong central hub that bolts into motor or engine of device. When we talk about quadcopters then these propellers work like wings for the aircraft. Types of wings attached to your tiny aircraft are going to make huge difference in its actual flight. So, if you are thinking to buy a new set of propellers for your drone then it is important to go into some deep details before selection. Below are few important things that demand your attention.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Things to Consider when Choosing Drone Propellers</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Best Brand Recommendations</a></li></ul><h2 id="Things-to-Consider-when-Choosing-Drone-Propellers"><a href="#Things-to-Consider-when-Choosing-Drone-Propellers" class="headerlink" title="Things to Consider when Choosing Drone Propellers"></a>Things to Consider when Choosing Drone Propellers</h2><h4 id="1-Type"><a href="#1-Type" class="headerlink" title="1. Type"></a>1. Type</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Plastic</td><td>They are Light in weight</td><td>You will find balancing issue with this design</td></tr><tr><td>Affordable choice</td><td>They produce annoying sound and too much vibrations</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Carban fiber</td><td>They suffer lesser vibration and produce minimal sound</td><td>Too costly</td></tr><tr><td>Lightweight construction</td><td>They offer lower thrust as compared to plastic type designs</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Highly balanced design</td><td>Flight time is lesser</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>They offer high RPM with quick motor speed.</td><td>If they crash, motor bearing will naturally take most of the impact.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Highly resposnive</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="2-Length-and-Pitch"><a href="#2-Length-and-Pitch" class="headerlink" title="2. Length and Pitch"></a>2. Length and Pitch</h4><p>Pitch can be defined as total distance travelled by your miniquad or drone with single rotation of propeller. For example, in case if we take 10x3.8 value then it means overall length is 10 whereas pitch is 3.8. Generally, propellers that offer lower pitches are able to produce more torque hence their motor naturally works with lesser current.</p><p>Those who are using high pitch type prop with have different results. In this case, more air gets displaced and it naturally caused more commotion. With this effect, drone will face more vibrations and you will observe more shakes while hovering. Hence, it is advised to buy propeller that offer lower pitch.</p><h4 id="3-Size"><a href="#3-Size" class="headerlink" title="3. Size"></a>3. Size</h4><p>If you have a drone propeller with small size then it is much easier to control overall speed of your device during flights. This facility is not available with larger propellers. The reason behind uncontrolled speed of larger prop type drones is that they need more time to shift from one speed level to another. But in other case, smaller drone prop are able to offer higher RPM for motors. With this higher RPM rating, blades are capable enough to spin fast and thus UAV can manage impressive flights.</p><p>Note that you must buy a motor that has lesser kV rating if you want to operate larger propellers. But in case if kV rating is high then it will suit to small sized props. Prefer to buy propellers with lower pitch values so that drones can stay stable in air.</p><h4 id="4-Number-of-Blades"><a href="#4-Number-of-Blades" class="headerlink" title="4. Number of Blades"></a>4. Number of Blades</h4><p>There is no doubt to say that you add more blades to your drone then its props will naturally have more thrust nut they actually become less efficient. The result is almost same as that of installing longer propeller. But if you have multiple blades then there is no need to install longer blades. Analysis says that tri blade type propellers are usually much better than that of two blade type props. Generally, tri blades type drone follow torque curve that ultimately makes yaw axis highly responsive.</p><h4 id="5-Price"><a href="#5-Price" class="headerlink" title="5. Price"></a>5. Price</h4><p>You can easily buy attractive multicolour type props; they are often available as pack of 4 or 2. While buying a new set, always make sure that your package contains equal number of clockwise and counter clockwise props. Generally, the plastic type props have price tag somewhere between $2 whereas for a set of 4, you have to pay $5. On the other side, the 3 plus bladed propellers use to be more expensive as compared to two blade versions.</p><h4 id="6-Conclusion"><a href="#6-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="6. Conclusion"></a>6. Conclusion</h4><p>After going through all these facts, we drive some important concluding points as:</p><ul><li>You can speed up a small sized prop with ease but larger ones take much time to shift from one speed level to another.</li><li>One need to install motor with higher RPM for smaller props as they are able to spin at faster pace and can naturally develop perfect lifting mechanism.</li><li>Lower kV type motors can easily deal with bigger props. If you require lesser vibration with higher stability then it is essential to move ahead with</li><li>Those who wish to perform acrobatics in air will demand motor connection with small props as it can offer fast turning motor design. Anything below 8 inches will suit your needs in this category.</li><li>In case if you want to organize flights with additional payload, like a video camera or gimbal etc then it is important to buy a larger prop with slower turning motor unit. Probably a 8 plus inch design will be best idea.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Brand-Recommendations"><a href="#Best-Brand-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Best Brand Recommendations"></a>Best Brand Recommendations</h2><h4 id="1-Gemfan"><a href="#1-Gemfan" class="headerlink" title="1. Gemfan:"></a>1. Gemfan:</h4><p>Gemfan is well known as a classic manufacturer of props; you can buy a unique design for every UAV. You can order a tri blade design for better performance.</p><h4 id="2-HQProp"><a href="#2-HQProp" class="headerlink" title="2. HQProp:"></a>2. HQProp:</h4><p>HQProp is a potential competitor against Gemfan and they are popular enough in the multirotor market. One of the most popular propellers in this market is 5x4x3 Tri-blade prop, you can easily find it with most of devices. Props of HQprop company are usually of higher price and they are also very fragile.</p><h4 id="3-APC"><a href="#3-APC" class="headerlink" title="3. APC:"></a>3. APC:</h4><p>Same as those DAL Props, APC’s 2 bladed props have unique reputation in market as they are rated to be indestructible designs. The specially designed tri blade offerings are highly durable and they stand out against all competitors in market.</p><h4 id="4-Luminier"><a href="#4-Luminier" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="From-Two-Dimensions-to-Three-Making-Text-Pop-in-Photoshop"><a href="#From-Two-Dimensions-to-Three-Making-Text-Pop-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="From Two-Dimensions to Three: Making Text Pop in Photoshop"></a>From Two-Dimensions to Three: Making Text Pop in Photoshop</h2><p>It’s three times better than regular text. A 3D text looks more professional, more creative, and just sits better on most pieces of content. Regardless of whether you need it for an image or for one of your videos. This guide will show you how to make a 3D text effect in Photoshop.</p><p>Then, you’ll learn about an alternative method that’s actually much easier. It may not be as popular as Photoshop but you will be surprised by the professional results even a beginner can achieve with this.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-3D-Text-Effect-in-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-3D-Text-Effect-in-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a 3D Text Effect in Adobe Photoshop"></a>How to Create a 3D Text Effect in Adobe Photoshop</h2><p>Photoshop is not the easiest image editing software to use. It can get really complex, really fast. But, with this, all you have to do is follow our steps. We’ll try to make it as straightforward as possible.</p><p>Step1 Open up Adobe Photoshop and create a New Document. Then, edit the document settings like this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="new document photoshop"                ></p><p>Step2 Select the <strong>Type</strong> tool and choose a color of your liking. Then, click anywhere on the blank canvas and type in your word.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/type-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="type text photoshop"                ></p><p>Step3 Now, locate the <strong>Layers</strong> panel at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Click on <strong>Layers</strong> <strong>→ right-click on your Text layer → select “New 3D Extrusion from Selected Layer”.</strong> Then, just click <strong>Yes</strong> on the new window that pops up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/layer-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="three d layer"                ></p><p>Step4 You are now editing in the 3D Workspace inside Photoshop. Here is where we will create the 3D text effect. First, click on the <strong>Layers</strong> panel <strong>→ right-click on “Background” →</strong> select <strong>“Postcard”.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/postcard-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="edit background"                ></p><p>Step5 Now, without touching anything else, hold on to the <strong>SHIFT</strong> key and click on your text layer. This will select the text and background layer at the same time. Then, just hold on <strong>CTRL + E &#x2F; Cmnd + E</strong>. This will merge the two layers.</p><p>Step6 Next, go to the 3D panel. Here, simply click on your Text layer. Then, from the <strong>Properties</strong> panel above, select a <strong>Shape Preset</strong> to be applied to your current text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preset-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="properties"                ></p><p>Step7 The next thing you need to do is add a light source. To do this, go back to the <strong>3D Panel →</strong> click on the <strong>Lightbulb</strong> button at the bottom <strong>→</strong> select <strong>“New Infinite Light”</strong>. Then, you can drag the circle in the middle of the text to set the direction of the light source.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/light-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="add light source photoshop"                ></p><p>Step8 You can now go to the Properties panel to adjust the 3D effects and light source effects even further. When you are done, simply click this highlighted button to render your creation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/render-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="render three d text"                ></p><p>Step9 We’re almost done. The next step is to go back to the <strong>Layers</strong> tab → right-click on the <strong>Background</strong> layer → click on <strong>“Convert to Smart Object”.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="convert to smart object"                ></p><p>Step10 Finally, from the upper-right corner drop-down button, select <strong>Essentials</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/essentials-adobe-photoshop.png"                      alt="convert back"                ></p><p>There you have it. You can now export your 3D text image from Photoshop and you’re done. Congratulations on learning how to make a 3D text effect in Photoshop.</p><h2 id="An-Easier-Way-to-Create-a-3D-Text-Effect-or-Animation"><a href="#An-Easier-Way-to-Create-a-3D-Text-Effect-or-Animation" class="headerlink" title="An Easier Way to Create a 3D Text Effect or Animation"></a>An Easier Way to Create a 3D Text Effect or Animation</h2><p>As we mentioned, Photoshop may get challenging to use, especially for complete beginners.

Both of these are compared in detail as below:</p><h4 id="1-Hardware"><a href="#1-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="1.Hardware"></a>1.Hardware</h4><p><strong>Touch Screen:</strong> When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yi-4k-touchscreen.jpg"                      alt="Yi 4K action camera touchscreen"                ></p><p> Image source:elproducente.com</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong> The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.</p><p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.</p><h4 id="2-Performance"><a href="#2-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Performance"></a>2.Performance</h4><p><strong>Image Resolution:</strong> Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.</p><p><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

But, after I completed the editing and tried exporting the file, the ‘Export’ button was grayed. Please is this a problem from Premiere? How can I fix it?”</em></p><p>The query above is from an Adobe Premiere user who is finding it difficult to export SRT from the software. If your situation is quite similar to his, then you’ve come to the right page to find a solution.</p><p>As experts in the technology industry, we took our time to review the ‘Exporting SRT from Premiere not working’ error, and fortunately, we’ve not just found the actual fix for the error, but also the reasons why it occurs. So, on this page, you’ll discover why Premiere pro export SRT fails and how to fix it. Stick with us.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Method 1: Use Export Media Option</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Premiere-Pro-Export-SRT-Subtitles-Fail"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Premiere-Pro-Export-SRT-Subtitles-Fail" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail"></a>Part 1: Why Does Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail</h2><p>There are several reasons why Premiere pro export SRT subtitles might fail. The common ones include;</p><p><strong>Wrong Element Selection in The Project Panel</strong></p><p>Yes, when you’re exporting SRT, if you fail to select the caption file before you use the relevant buttons for exportation, the “Export” option will be grayed out. Hence, preventing you from being able to export the SRT file.</p><p><strong>Improper settings selection</strong></p><p>If, unfortunately, you select the wrong settings for your file during the exportation of SRT, there’s a high chance that you’ll not be able to complete the export action successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-Premiere-Pro-Export-SRT-Subtitles-Fail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-Premiere-Pro-Export-SRT-Subtitles-Fail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail"></a>Part 2: How to Fix Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail</h2><p>Fixing the Premiere pro export subtitles fail error is not a daunting task if you know the right tricks to execute the operation. Here, we’ve explained three methods that are not just reliable but also work for fixing export SRT from Premiere pro not working issue. Keep reading to find out more about these fixes.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-Export-Media-Option"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Export-Media-Option" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Export Media Option"></a>Method 1: Use Export Media Option</h3><p>The “Export Media” option in Adobe Premiere Pro is effective for exporting SRT without problems. However, using this method means you’re exploring the .srt file with a video file. The process to use this method is outlined below;</p><p>Step1 Firstly, right-click on the SRT file from the Premiere pro software project panel. Then select ‘Export Media.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-1.jpg"                      alt="select export media"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you click on “Export Media” you’ll notice different options. Ignore the video export options (or tick off ‘video’ if you like), then navigate down to the “Captions tab”.</p><p>Step3 Click on “Create Sidecar File” under ‘Export Options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-2.jpg"                      alt="click on create sidecar file"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, navigate to ‘File Format’ and select SubRip Subtitle Format (.srt). Then hit the “Export” button to complete the operation.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Export-SRT-as-Sidecar-File"><a href="#Method-2-Export-SRT-as-Sidecar-File" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File"></a>Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File</h3><p>Another way to export SRT files from Adobe Premiere Pro is by exporting the file as a sidecar file. You might ask “What is a sidecar file?” A sidecar file refers to a computer file that stores data that is not supported by the format of its source file. The sidecar file from the source could be more than one, and it could contain meta databases.</p><p>Now let’s take a look at the step-by-step process to export SRT as a sidecar file.</p><p>Step1 Click on the “SRT File” from the Premiere Pro interface.</p><p>Step2 Navigate to “File” and select Exports, then choose “Captions”. By doing so, you’ll be able to export the SRT file.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Export-SRT-File-with-Timestamps"><a href="#Method-3-Export-SRT-File-with-Timestamps" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps"></a>Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps</h3><p>The previously mentioned methods will allow you to export SRT either with video or as a sidecar file. But if you’re looking to export SRT file with timestamps, this method will work for you. The process is straightforward as the prior discussed methods.</p><p>Here is how the process works;</p><p>Step1 Firstly, select SEQUENCE in the project panel.</p><p>Step2 Up next, click File -&gt; Export -&gt; Captions. Once you complete that, you’ll export the SRT file as a sidecar file with timestamps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-3.jpg"                      alt="open export settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> for this to work, the video must be on one video layer.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easiest-Actionable-Fix-Edit-and-Export-SRT-Files-Only-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Easiest-Actionable-Fix-Edit-and-Export-SRT-Files-Only-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>If Adobe Premiere Pro is still giving you issues with exporting SRT file from its interface, the best and easiest solution is to edit the SRT file on a powerful software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Keep reading to find out more about these fixes.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-Export-Media-Option-1"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Export-Media-Option-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Export Media Option"></a>Method 1: Use Export Media Option</h3><p>The “Export Media” option in Adobe Premiere Pro is effective for exporting SRT without problems. However, using this method means you’re exploring the .srt file with a video file. The process to use this method is outlined below;</p><p>Step1 Firstly, right-click on the SRT file from the Premiere pro software project panel. Then select ‘Export Media.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-1.jpg"                      alt="select export media"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you click on “Export Media” you’ll notice different options. Ignore the video export options (or tick off ‘video’ if you like), then navigate down to the “Captions tab”.</p><p>Step3 Click on “Create Sidecar File” under ‘Export Options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-2.jpg"                      alt="click on create sidecar file"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, navigate to ‘File Format’ and select SubRip Subtitle Format (.srt). Then hit the “Export” button to complete the operation.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Export-SRT-as-Sidecar-File-1"><a href="#Method-2-Export-SRT-as-Sidecar-File-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File"></a>Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File</h3><p>Another way to export SRT files from Adobe Premiere Pro is by exporting the file as a sidecar file. You might ask “What is a sidecar file?” A sidecar file refers to a computer file that stores data that is not supported by the format of its source file. The sidecar file from the source could be more than one, and it could contain meta databases.</p><p>Now let’s take a look at the step-by-step process to export SRT as a sidecar file.</p><p>Step1 Click on the “SRT File” from the Premiere Pro interface.</p><p>Step2 Navigate to “File” and select Exports, then choose “Captions”. By doing so, you’ll be able to export the SRT file.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Export-SRT-File-with-Timestamps-1"><a href="#Method-3-Export-SRT-File-with-Timestamps-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps"></a>Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps</h3><p>The previously mentioned methods will allow you to export SRT either with video or as a sidecar file. But if you’re looking to export SRT file with timestamps, this method will work for you. The process is straightforward as the prior discussed methods.</p><p>Here is how the process works;</p><p>Step1 Firstly, select SEQUENCE in the project panel.</p><p>Step2 Up next, click File -&gt; Export -&gt; Captions. Once you complete that, you’ll export the SRT file as a sidecar file with timestamps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-3.jpg"                      alt="open export settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> for this to work, the video must be on one video layer.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easiest-Actionable-Fix-Edit-and-Export-SRT-Files-Only-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Part-3-Easiest-Actionable-Fix-Edit-and-Export-SRT-Files-Only-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>If Adobe Premiere Pro is still giving you issues with exporting SRT file from its interface, the best and easiest solution is to edit the SRT file on a powerful software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, <strong>can you speed up Facebook videos</strong> still?</p><p>The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools.

In this case, it is best to use different external solutions that you can install to make speed changes to the video. Browser extensions are useful for desktop users, while iOS and Android users can try apps.</p><p>However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.</p><p>Try all the methods mentioned in this post and watch the video on Facebook at your preferred speed choice.</p><p><ins

In addition, gaming monitors are a completely new concept for many console owners. It was easy to choose a 4K TV with Xbox One, but we experienced some interesting alternatives when the next generation came along.</p><p>As console owners gravitate toward monitors in order to take advantage of the incredible framerates and resolutions the Xbox Series X can deliver, the pull of monitors appears to be increasing. Let’s check out some of our top picks for the best monitors for Xbox Series X, and keep in mind that HDMI 2.1 monitors are on the way, so if you’re interested in seeing what’s coming, please head over to our top picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                      alt="xbox-seriesx"                ></p><h4 id="Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="Using a monitor with Xbox Series X"></a><strong>Using a monitor with Xbox Series X</strong></h4><p>The best way to enjoy Xbox Series X is to get a monitor that supports either 8K at 60hz or 4K at 120hz, which means that you’ll need an HDMI 2.1 monitor. In spite of the fact that there are some amazing HDMI 2.1 cable options out there, HDMI 2.1 monitors are not as common as they could be at this moment, but we expect them to appear soon.</p><p>Accordingly, the most common monitor options available for Xbox Series X gamers as of right now are 1080p at 120Hz, 1440p at 120Hz, or 4K at 60Hz. Even though 120hz gaming doesn’t require an HDMI 2.1 monitor, one popular approach involves lowering the resolution while increasing framerates. The ability to play either racing or FPS games at 1080p at 120Hz would be an example of this.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Monitors For Your ps5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best TVs You Can Find in 2024 for ps5 and Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Our Top Picks For Best Xbox Series X Monitors</strong></p><h4 id="1-Samsung-Odyssey-G7-32-Inch"><a href="#1-Samsung-Odyssey-G7-32-Inch" class="headerlink" title="1.

This computer monitor features a curving screen and a response time of 1 ms, allowing for an immersive gaming experience. The ultra-smooth action is made possible by a 240 Hz refresh rate.</p><p>In addition to QLED’s lifelike colors, the monitor’s curvature lets you fit your peripherals deeper into the game. Besides offering G-Sync and FreeSync compatibility, the Odyssey G7 also has variable external lighting design options.</p><h4 id="2-Gigabyte-AORUS-27-Inch-Curved-Gaming-Monitor"><a href="#2-Gigabyte-AORUS-27-Inch-Curved-Gaming-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="2.

It features a contrast ratio of 3000:1 and HDR, giving gamers a more immersive and realistic gaming experience. There is no question that this is not a ‘budget’ monitor, but its design is pretty epic (with LEDs too), and it could work well with a number of different types of games, including fast-paced FPSes as well as upcoming slower and dramatic releases.</p><h4 id="3-ASUS-VP28UQG-28-Inch-4K"><a href="#3-ASUS-VP28UQG-28-Inch-4K" class="headerlink" title="3.

The monitor has outstanding motion handling and an excellent 1080p resolution. The stand allows you to adjust the ergonomics and it’s decently well-built. There are wide viewing angles on the IPS panel, which makes it easy to see even in bright settings. As a result of its low contrast ratio, it is not suitable for dark rooms.</p><p>There are no blur trails behind fast-moving objects because the display is exceptionally responsive, whether you play at 120Hz or 60Hz. Additionally, it has an image duplication-free backlight, which reduces eye strain and reduces eye strain. The variable refresh rate works in a wide range of refresh rates, so even if frame rates are low, you get almost no tearing.</p><h4 id="5-DELL-S2721QS"><a href="#5-DELL-S2721QS" class="headerlink" title="5.

It also has an IPS panel but is an inch smaller than the Acer Nitro XV282K. However, it still offers good response times and VRR support despite its lack of HDMI 2.1 ports and 60Hz refresh rate. Due to its lack of USB ports, and lack of gaming features, the laptop doesn’t have many gaming capabilities. However, you do get built-in speakers, and you can also use Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture to display two input sources simultaneously, ideal for gaming while watching a movie or a show.</p><p>Go with the Acer if you can afford it. Due to its higher refresh rate and faster response times, it’s a much more efficient gaming monitor. However, if your budget is limited, the Dell would be a good alternative.</p><h4 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h4><p>These are some of our top pics for the best monitors for Xbox Series X.
