    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Become-a-Successful-SMM-in-10-Steps"><a href="#Become-a-Successful-SMM-in-10-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Become a Successful SMM in 10 Steps"></a>Become a Successful SMM in 10 Steps</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-1.jpg"                      alt="introduction"                ></p><p>Within the world of social media marketing, there are many different strategies. All of these options can make it easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>But don’t worry! We’ve got some tried-and-true tips that can help you get started on your SMM journey.</p><h2 id="What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM"><a href="#What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM" class="headerlink" title="What is social media marketing (SMM)?"></a>What is social media marketing (SMM)?</h2><p>Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.</p><p>Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.</p><p>So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.</p><p><strong>1. Design Your Strategies</strong></p><p>You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.</p><p>After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it’s consistent!</p><p>Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values&#x2F;beliefs&#x2F;needs&#x2F;desires (whatever they may be).</p><p>Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).</p><p><strong>2. Starting Live Broadcast</strong></p><p>Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.</p><p>If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.</p><p>What You’ll Need:</p><ul><li>A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.</li><li>When using a laptop, ensure there’s no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what’s happening on screen when watching via computer&#x2F;laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).</li></ul><p><strong>3. Social Media Influencer</strong></p><p>Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p><p>Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.</p><p>Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts&#x2F;content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-2.jpg"                      alt="social media influencer"                ></p><p><strong>4. Create Subscription Options</strong></p><p>Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.</p><p>To create a subscription option:</p><ul><li>Navigate to “Customize” on the top right corner of your page and select “Subscription Options” from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Enter your desired name and description, then click “Save Changes” at the bottom of this section</li><li>To set up a subscription:</li></ul><p><strong>5. Engage with your Audience</strong></p><p>Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:</p><ul><li>Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they’re being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.</li><li>Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.</li><li>Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!</li></ul><p><strong>6. Create User Generated Content</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember that social media is about the community, so it’s important to encourage your audience members to create content.</p><p>If you’re not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you’re losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:</p><ul><li>Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.</li><li>If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Create a Positive Brand Image</strong></p><p>Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.</p><p>Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website’s design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-3.jpg"                      alt="create a positive brand image"                ></p><p>It’s a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there’s no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.</p><p><strong>8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand</strong></p><p>The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.</p><p>Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.</p><p><strong>9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends</strong></p><p>Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry.

It was the very first device in action camera series that supported 4K resolution at 30fps frame rate because all the early models were limited to 15fps speed.</p><p> GoPro Hero4 Black can easily meat all requirements of action camera lovers and at the same time it is available at lower price range. The video quality of Hero4 Black can be rated high and is perfectly suitable for all those who are not in a stage to spend more. On the other side Drift Ghost S comes with an attractive bundle of accessories like wireless remote and it offers long battery life. With payment of $285 for Drift Ghost S, you will be able to make broader settings for video shooting while using its high speed and normal mode.</p><p> The complete comparison provided below in this article will help you to make decision about on which camera you must keep your eye in 2017:</p><h2 id="Complete-Comparison"><a href="#Complete-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Complete Comparison"></a>Complete Comparison</h2><h4 id="Specs-Comparison-between-Ghost-S-and-Hero4-Black"><a href="#Specs-Comparison-between-Ghost-S-and-Hero4-Black" class="headerlink" title="Specs Comparison between Ghost-S and Hero4 Black"></a>Specs Comparison between Ghost-S and Hero4 Black</h4><p>| |  GoPro Hero4 Black | Drift Ghost-S                                              |                                                   |<br>| ——————– | ———————————————————- | ————————————————- |<br>| Price                | $329                                                       | $284.95                                           |<br>| Image Sensor         | 12 MP CMOS Sensor                                          | 12MP Sensor backlit CMOS                          |<br>| Battery              | 1160mAh (1hr 4K@30fps)                                     | 1700mAh (3.5hrs 1080P@30fps)                      |<br>| Lens                 | Wide Angle                                                 | 2.97 +&#x2F;- 0.5, 300 Rotatable Lens                  |<br>| Built-in Memory      | N&#x2F;A                                                        | 2GB DDR2 SDRAM + 256MB SLC Nand Flash             |<br>| Display              | N&#x2F;A                                                        | 2” TFT LCD                                        |<br>| Memory Capacity      | Up to 64GB MicroSD Card, MicroSDXC Card and MicroSDHC Card | SDXC MicroSD card, Up to 64GB Class 10&#x2F;UHS-1 SDHC |<br>| Connectivity         | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Micro HDMI-D, Mini-USB                   | WiFi: Mini HDMI C Mini-B USB                      |<br>| Frame Rates          | up to 4k 30&#x2F;25&#x2F;24 fps,                                     | up to 1080p 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;50&#x2F;60 fps                       |<br>| Remote Control       | Yes                                                        | Yes                                               |<br>| Photo Resolution     | Up to 12MP                                                 | Up to 12MP                                        |<br>| Loop Recording       | Yes                                                        | Yes                                               |<br>| Burst Photo          | 12MP @ 30 fps                                              | 12MP @10fps                                       |<br>| Waterproof           | 40m (with housing)                                         | 3m (without housing)                              |<br>| APP                  | Yes                                                        | Yes                                               |<br>| Built-in Mic         | Yes                                                        | Yes                                               |<br>| Weight               | 88g (camera only)                                          | 172g                                              |<br>| External Mic         | Supported                                                  | Supported                                         |<br>| Zoom                 | N&#x2F;A                                                        | 10X                                               |<br>| Built-in Speaker     | N&#x2F;A                                                        | Yes                                               |<br>| Scene mode           | Low Light                                                  | Normal Vivid Low Light                            |<br>| Clone mode           | N&#x2F;A                                                        | Yes                                               |</p><p> This comparison table shows that touchscreen feature is missing in Hero4 Black but it is capable to shoot 4K videos. On the other side, Ghost S is equipped with LCD screen but it cannot shoot beyond 1080p with 60fps. One more advantage of Ghost S device is that its lens can be rotated up to 360 degrees that leads to much effective image alignment during shoots and the touchscreen put another edge on its video stability.</p><h4 id="Features-Comparison"><a href="#Features-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Features Comparison:"></a><strong>Features Comparison:</strong></h4><h4 id="1-Design-Structure"><a href="#1-Design-Structure" class="headerlink" title="1.

At the same time you will be able to access buttons on the top for all major controls like left&#x2F;right navigation, Menu and power button that provides direct control over Select&#x2F;Play and Record functions. A bright LED is provided to reflect the recording status all the time and on the back portion a removable cover is used to hide the 3.5 mm mic jack, Mini USB port, Mini HDMI, Micro SD and battery. A standard screw mount along with speaker is connected at right side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Drift_Ghost-S_35832568_design.jpg"                      alt="Drift-Ghost-S-35832568-design"                ></p><p> Hero 4 Black layout is really impressive with a Wi-Fi button on the right side and a special setting button that assists in immediate adjustment of camera modes.

And if we talk about 1080p resolution level then frame rate of Hero4 Black is exactly twice as that of Ghost S because the former one serves with 120fps and later can go up to 60fps only.</p><p> Need to correct the fisheye in the post production?

Battery Life"></a>4.  Battery Life</h4><p> Hero4 Black consists of a removable 1160mAh battery that can work up to one hour and 5 minutes with 4K resolution and if you record at 1080p&#x2F;30fps then this battery life can be extended up to 1.5 hours only. In case of Drift Ghost S you have 1700 mAh battery that can work up to 3.5 hours while recording videos at 1080p&#x2F;30fps. If you switch on the WiFi during recording then battery life is automatically decayed in Hero4 Black.</p><h4 id="5-WaterProof"><a href="#5-WaterProof" class="headerlink" title="5.  WaterProof"></a>5.  WaterProof</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Ghost S device is waterproof even without any additional housing arrangement so it also provides much better audio quality. This action cam can go under water up to 3 m without any housing whereas if you attach housing then it allows recording up to 60m. On the other side, Hero4 Black is not water proof at all and even with the additional housing you can take it up to 40 m below water.</p><p> Want to know more action cameras with waterproof capacity?<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check Top 7 Best Waterproof Action Camera For 2017 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Scene-Mode"><a href="#5-Scene-Mode" class="headerlink" title="5.  Scene Mode"></a>5.  Scene Mode</h4><p> Drift comes with few additional scene modes: Low Light, Vivid and Normal. Low light mode assists in better clarity during night hours, Vivid helps to push up color information whereas normal mode add more natural colors to footage. On the other side, Hero4 Black comes with only one scene mode that is Low Light. It helps to develop better resolution at night so that more details can be accessed.</p><h4 id="6-Video-Tagging-Ghost-S-and-HiLight-Tag-GoPro"><a href="#6-Video-Tagging-Ghost-S-and-HiLight-Tag-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="6.  Video Tagging (Ghost S) and HiLight Tag (GoPro)"></a>6.  Video Tagging (Ghost S) and HiLight Tag (GoPro)</h4><p> The GoPro Hero4 Black device is designed with one additional feature named as HiLight Tagging where by pressing the side button you can allow the application to automatically mark the special moments in video footage.</p><p> The video tagging feature in Ghost S allows users to save the highlighted moments separately in the whole video so that they can be easily recognized later. This feature can be applied to all current, future and past videos.</p><h4 id="8-App"><a href="#8-App" class="headerlink" title="8.  App"></a>8.  App</h4><p> Hero4 Black works with GoPro App that assists in easy connectivity over smartphones and also helps in remote navigation. The same feature is supported by Ghost S with its own Drift App that works over iOS and Android platform. GoPro Application also supports Window platform along with iOS and Android.</p><h4 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h4><p> The only major question that you must ask yourself before selection of camera is whether you need a 4K resolution or not? Because if it is your requirement then you have to go for Hero4 Black but as all other features are equally comparable so otherwise users can prefer to buy Ghost S device.

New updates of the app always bring new features, but many users miss out on the minute new changes and feature add-ons that are meant to make the overall experience and usability a lot easier and more fun. So here is a jotted down list of the coolest <strong>WhatsApp Tricks</strong> that you may not know of yet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</a></li><li><a href="#part2">What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease</a></li></ul><h2 id="Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy"><a href="#Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy" class="headerlink" title="Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy"></a>Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</h2><p>You can do a lot of things with your WhatsApp fonts, appearance, and texts that will make your messages look oh-so-edgy! From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.</p><h4 id="1-Bold"><a href="#1-Bold" class="headerlink" title="1.Bold"></a>1.Bold</h4><p>Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic"><a href="#2-Italic" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol (_text_) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough"><a href="#3-Strikethrough" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace"><a href="#4-Monospace" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.</p><h4 id="4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords"><a href="#4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="4.Search Old Chats with Keywords"></a>4.Search Old Chats with Keywords</h4><p>As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings&gt;&gt; Apps and Notifications &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp"                ></p><h4 id="7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days"><a href="#7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days" class="headerlink" title="7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days"></a>7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days</h4><p>Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Advanced-Techniques-for-Sharing-SRT-Data-on-Vimeo-and-LinkedIn"><a href="#Advanced-Techniques-for-Sharing-SRT-Data-on-Vimeo-and-LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Techniques for Sharing SRT Data on Vimeo and LinkedIn"></a>Advanced Techniques for Sharing SRT Data on Vimeo and LinkedIn</h2><p>If you’re a content creator, then you should know the importance of adding subtitles to your videos.</p><p>Today, a lot of social media users, especially on Facebook, tend to watch videos without turning on the sounds. But the big question is ‘If your audience doesn’t turn on the sound of your videos, how do they get the message you’re trying to pass?” Well, this is why adding ‘Subtitles’ to your videos is crucial. However, for a subtitle to work, it needs to comply with the structure of a video player or any platform you intend to use it on. And fortunately, SRT is a universal format, making it usable on any social media platform.</p><p>In this guide, you’ll be introduced to the simple methods you can utilize to upload SRT files to social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. But before we proceed, let’s take a look at an overview of the different social media platforms and the subtitle file formats they support.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Social Media Platform</th><th>SRT</th><th>VTT</th><th>STL</th><th>SSA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YouTube</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vimeo</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the overview table above, it’s obvious you can easily create one SRT file and easily use it on different social media channels. This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to. Then click ‘Add Language’ and select the language you wrote your Subtitle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="add language"                ></p><p>Step3Click Add under the Subtitle section and upload your SRT file through the pop-up that appears on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets"><a href="#Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets"></a>Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets</h2><p>Before now, Twitter users can only upload SRT files to video via the ‘Media Studio’, but this feature was not available to all users, making it difficult for some users to add subtitles to their videos.</p><p>However, the new version of Twitter now allows users to easily add SRT files to their tweets from the ‘Compose Tweet’ area.

This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to. Then click ‘Add Language’ and select the language you wrote your Subtitle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="add language"                ></p><p>Step3Click Add under the Subtitle section and upload your SRT file through the pop-up that appears on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets-1"><a href="#Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets"></a>Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets</h2><p>Before now, Twitter users can only upload SRT files to video via the ‘Media Studio’, but this feature was not available to all users, making it difficult for some users to add subtitles to their videos.</p><p>However, the new version of Twitter now allows users to easily add SRT files to their tweets from the ‘Compose Tweet’ area.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Breaking-Barriers-with-Excellent-Job-Interview-Techniques"><a href="#Breaking-Barriers-with-Excellent-Job-Interview-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Barriers with Excellent Job Interview Techniques"></a>Breaking Barriers with Excellent Job Interview Techniques</h2><p>Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It’s a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.</p><p>However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.</p><h2 id="1-Keep-your-intro-brief"><a href="#1-Keep-your-intro-brief" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your intro brief"></a>1. Keep your intro brief</h2><p>The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.</p><p>Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don’t have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.</p><h2 id="2-Stay-in-the-theme"><a href="#2-Stay-in-the-theme" class="headerlink" title="2. Stay in the theme"></a>2. Stay in the theme</h2><p>While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won’t be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.</p><p>Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you’ll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.</p><h2 id="3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count"><a href="#3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count" class="headerlink" title="3. Make the first 7 seconds count"></a>3. Make the first 7 seconds count</h2><p>Although branding is important, it won’t guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don’t provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.</p><p>Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.</p><p>Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn’t yours or if it’s obvious that you’re not interested in the subjects you raise.</p><h2 id="4-Make-a-plan"><a href="#4-Make-a-plan" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a plan"></a>4. Make a plan</h2><p>The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don’t divide them up into manageable portions, you’ll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.</p><p>One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don’t necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.</p><h2 id="5-Include-a-Call-To-Action"><a href="#5-Include-a-Call-To-Action" class="headerlink" title="5. Include a Call-To-Action"></a>5. Include a Call-To-Action</h2><p>Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won’t get as a content creator if you don’t ask, and this also applies to YouTube.</p><p>After you’ve written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.</p><p>Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you’ll come out as uncertain of your goal.</p><h2 id="6-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#6-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="6. Keep it simple"></a>6. Keep it simple</h2><p>It’s simple to assume that more is better when creating a YouTube channel. However, if you’re just starting out, the opposite is typically true.</p><p>Make a thorough inventory of everything you could include before putting together your YouTube intro. After you’ve written down everything you can think of, pick down the one or two most crucial elements.</p><p>You’ll save a lot of time by making your YouTube intro simpler. Additionally, it will make your channel feel more cohesive.</p><h2 id="7-Create-a-stunning-intro"><a href="#7-Create-a-stunning-intro" class="headerlink" title="7. Create a stunning intro"></a>7. Create a stunning intro</h2><p>For the majority of producers, creating a successful YouTube channel takes years of trial and error. A perfectionist attitude will hold you back in the beginning, especially when it comes to your introduction.</p><p>Make a YouTube opening that’s decent enough to get you started rather than aiming to create something ideal. You can adjust as needed as your talents advance and your understanding of the path you want to go in deepens.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-thankful-discoveries-unlimited-outro-options/"><u>2024 Approved  Thankful Discoveries  Unlimited Outro Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-strategies-for-sustaining-viewer-interest-in-online-events/"><u>[Updated] Strategies for Sustaining Viewer Interest in Online Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-proiphone-photo-techniques-for-beginners/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Proiphone Photo Techniques for Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-yuneec-typhoon-h-examined-a-drone-review-perspective/"><u>[New] In 2024, Yuneec Typhoon H Examined  A Drone Review Perspective</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-pixelpunmatic-device/"><u>[New] PixelPunmatic Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-the-listening-experience-with-garageband-edits-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevate the Listening Experience with GarageBand Edits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/integrating-skype-into-zoom-meetings-made-simple-for-2024/"><u>Integrating Skype Into Zoom Meetings Made Simple for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/in-2024-powerful-book-trailer-examples/"><u>In 2024, Powerful Book Trailer Examples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/premium-4k-screen-capturing-solutions-for-2024/"><u>Premium 4K Screen Capturing Solutions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-guaranteeing-your-stream-uninterrupted-by-ads-on-fb/"><u>In 2024, Guaranteeing Your Stream Uninterrupted by Ads on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-battle-tested-selecting-the-supreme-7-fps/"><u>2024 Approved  Battle Tested  Selecting the Supreme 7 FPS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-oppo-a59-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On Oppo A59 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-pinnacle-of-funny-photo-artistry/"><u>In 2024, Pinnacle of Funny Photo Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/mastering-windows-pc-live-tv-recording-tips-and-tricks/"><u>Mastering Windows PC  Live TV Recording Tips & Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-proven-ways-in-how-to-hide-location-on-life360-for-realme-v30t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Proven Ways in How To Hide Location on Life360 For Realme V30T | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-top-10-social-media-video-tools/"><u>In-Depth Look  Top 10 Social Media Video Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-hidefake-snapchat-location-on-your-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Samsung Galaxy A15 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
