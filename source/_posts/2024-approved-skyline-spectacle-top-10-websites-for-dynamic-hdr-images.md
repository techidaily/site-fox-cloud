![hdri skies](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-2.jpg)

Rating: 4.5/5

Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location. It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.
