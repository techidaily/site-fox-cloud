## Related FAQs About Boomerang Maker

****Is there a limit on the Size of the Boomerang Video?**

Although you can technically create a boomerang video that is as long as you want, the length of the video you can make may be limited by the boomerang maker that you choose to use. You may also find that longer boomerang videos lose their effect after a while and therefore we recommend sticking to shorter looped videos that are much easier to share online, particularly on social media platforms.

****Can You Make a Boomerang Video Using an Exiting Video?**

Yes. Most solutions allow you to use an exciting video to create a boomerang video. But it is important to note that sometimes you may want to shoot a video that you can then use to create a boomerang video and therefore you should choose a tool that will allow you to do both. It is also worth pointing out that some tools are easier to use than others and you want to pick a solution that simplifies the process.

****What is the Best Way to Make a Boomerang Video?**

The best tool that you can use to create a boomerang video for any purpose is Wondershare Filmora. This is because not only will you easily loop the video to create the boomerang effect, but you can also use its numerous effects and features to embellish the video as much as you want. Since you can export the video in numerous different formats, it can be used to create videos for all sorts of purposes.

## Conclusion

If you have long admired the boomerang videos that you see on social media and have been wondering how they are made, now you have four different ways to create your own and share them on social media.
