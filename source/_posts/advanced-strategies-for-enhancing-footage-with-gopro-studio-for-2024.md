## Part 1: How to Edit GoPro Videos with GoPro Studio

#### 1\. **Importing videos**

 First step for editing is importing the video files from the GoPro. Open the GoPro Studio and then, you will find a blue colour button on the top left corner of the window labelled as "Import New Files". Click on that button and select the files that you want to include.

#### 2\. **Trimming**

 After you have imported the videos, cut the unnecessary portion of the videos that you are not interested to include, this trimming or cutting should be done before you start the actual editing.  
For that, click on the thumbnails of the videos and then on "play". This will result into playing the video. There are two trimming buttons on the left of the window that you can use for marking the beginning and ending of the clip which you want to include. In this way, you can select the number of videos clips that you want to include in your video.
