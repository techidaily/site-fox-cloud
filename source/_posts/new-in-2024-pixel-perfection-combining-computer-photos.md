## Part 1\. 5 ways to overlay photos online

### 1\. Online Image Editor

Online Image Editor is a free online tool that makes the image overlay operation easy to do. Moreover, this website does not put any limit on the number of images or photos to be superimposed, even if the only way to do it is to overlap them one at a time, and not altogether. In practice, Online Image Editor works literally in layers, with the next image that overlaps with the previous one, and so on. To underline the fact that the images should not necessarily be superimposed, but also juxtaposed to one another on the same background, or rotated, or with various background effects such as shadows.

![online image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-1.jpg)

Pros

* The user interface is simple and friendly with numerous editing features
* Images can be crafted in an excellent manner
* Optimum and consistent performance is assured
* Fotor offers a one-tap enhancement tool that spontaneously touches up normal images

Cons

* Many distractive ads keep showing up
* Special image editing background is required
* Effects cannot be tweaked with Fotor
* The font sizes cannot be changed in an independent manner
* In the free version, many features and functionalities have been disabled

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. LunaPic

LunaPic is another free site to superimpose images online. As in the previous case, you can overlay multiple photos, but only one by one, using tools such as transparency control, the various effects of shade, and course the rotation. In addition, you can upload photos not only from your PC but also from social networks like Facebook or simply from Google Images. The main flaw, of Online Image Editor, is the impossibility of canceling the overlap of the first images: you can only delete the last one you added.
