#### 2. Make it a story

If you jump from one topic to another, not linked, then the ideas are challenging to understand. So, when you create a slideshow, make it a story then the idea will get conveyed just right.

#### 5. Music

While creating a video, music added to it will keep intact the audience so that they will not feel bored. You could use the same here; thus, it grabs the viewers' attention when adding business slideshow music.
