If you do not fancy 3D texts and you want a simple but effective intro video, this can suit you perfectly. The text has a 2D texture and the animations are very basic. However, it manages to create an impact in the eyes of the beholders.

There are several dynamic geometric shapes available that enhance the animations and effects on the texts. The text performs twists and turns along with shakes with the beats. The background color is black and hence, the focus is on the text and its surrounding visible objects.

### 8\. 3D Cool Gold Intro

There is a craze for gold effects in texts and titles. This is another 3D text-based template but the text effect truly stands out. It is definitely a majestic effect that is a treat to the eyes. Thereafter, there are spins of the entire title as well as the individual characters.

The overall frame animation adds to the animation immensely. The background is dark but colorful that matches well with the text effect. This is enhancing the overall text effect thanks to the dynamic movement of the elements.

### 10\. Blue Intro

If you prefer an outer space dynamic background with titles floating, this is exactly the same. The title floats in outer space in slow motion. Thereafter, it creates an impactful transition from slow to sudden shock motion. All the while the background has shooting stars that adds to the overall animation.

The title is in 3D texture. A graphical object in the shape of the planetary ring has been used for enhancing the effect. Along with those, there is the light dispersion and blurry effect that makes the text stand out.
