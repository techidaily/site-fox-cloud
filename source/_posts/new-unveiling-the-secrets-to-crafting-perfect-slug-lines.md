## Part 1\. Everything you need to know about slug line

### What is Slug Line?

A Slug Line is a screenplay written in all uppercase letters to make the script information prominent. It is a term used in old times when there were no advanced technology and printers were typed by small sticks called typewriters. It helps the viewer to understand the actions of the specific character.

### The Function of slug line

The main heading scene is responsible for starting an enthusiasm in the background. Slug lines establish the main scene properly. These are the scripts used to break up the length of a scene and can also be used to create pace in different types of scenes. It describes the essential points of a scene more prominently.

### Some Basic Formats

1. **English should be written in Capital.**
2. **Mark Interior/Exterior view**

EXT. (exterior)

INT. (interior)

EXT./INT. or INT./EXT. :

It means that the scene will continuously move from outside to inside or vice versa.

1. **Scene Location**

This section explains two primary subjects: how the scenario is presented and what happens there (the character's actions). When writing this part, keep the following things in mind. Well first, dialogue cannot directly follow a slug line; instead, there are usually scenes and descriptions of action. Second, because the screenplay is not a novel, psychological or other non-visual descriptions must be avoided to convey what the "audience" can see. Rather than, you should simply describe the emotional shifts in the character, giving the actor some leeway to perform naturally.

1. **Time**

The determination of time is also a basic format. For example, DAY, NIGHT, etc. Generally, all of them are followed by a "-".

1. **An Example of Slug Line**

It's common to describe a video as having a cinematic sense and aesthetic, which is mostly based on the overall color tone of the video. However, expert-level custom color matching demands not only your expertise but also your own color sensitivity, therefore it is not recommended for all beginners. With the help of a range of in-app preset LUTs, you can simply alter the color of your films and give them a more cinematic feel using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
