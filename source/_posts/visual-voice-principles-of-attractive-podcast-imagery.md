### When to use

## Part 2\. Do I Need a Logo for My Podcast?

Many users feel that visuals are a minor aspect of podcasts and often overlook it. It's true that podcasts mainly consist of audio, but a visual representation is just as important. Let's go over why having a good podcast logo is crucial.

* Sets the first impression for new listeners.
* Boost the credibility of your work in the eyes of the audience.
* Required by most major podcast publishing platforms.
* Acts as a reusable marketing tool that can also be used elsewhere.
