### How to Use Voicemeeter to Modify your Voice

Follow the detailed instructions below to edit your Vtube voice using Voicemeeter:

Step1 Download and install Voicemeeter from the official webpage via an internet-enabled computer system. Once the installation process is complete, restart your Windows operating system, and set up the app for usage.

Locate the **Start** icon at the bottom left corner of your screen and click on it.

![start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-000.png)

Select **Settings** from the options that comes up, and the interface below will come up:

![settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-001.png)

Step2 Next, click on **Sounds** to configure some defaults

Click on the **Playback** panel, and scroll to where you have VoiceMeeter Input. Right-click on **VoiceMeeter Input** and a couple of options will come up. Select **Set as Default Device** to proceed.

![set as default device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-002.png)

Next, right-click **VoiceMeeter Aux Input**, and select **Set as Default Communication Device**.

Step3 Now navigate to the **Recording** panel to configure it.

Some options will come up underneath just as in the Playback panel. Scroll down and right-click **VoiceMeeter Input**. Tap on **Set as Default Device**.

Locate the **VoiceMeeter Aux Input**, right-click on it and pick **Set as Default Device** from the options that appear underneath.

Step4 Now that you've successfully configured your computer sound system with VoiceMeeter, let's move to setting up the VoiceMeeter app itself.

![virtual audio input section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-005.png)

Virtual Audio Input 2: This is where windows send all of your communication traffic from social media platforms.

Virtual Audio Input 3: This is where windows will send signals from music apps like Spotify, etc.

Rename **Virtual Audio Input 1**, **2** & **3** as **PC Audio**, **Communication**, and **Music** respectively.

Step6 Once the above setup is complete, move to the **Hardware Outputs** section and configure it. There are 8 hardware output panels. You need to edit each one of them. Here is an image of what the output panels look like:
