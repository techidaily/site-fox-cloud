## Achieving Gentle Growth of Silence in Audio Production

Fruity loop studio, also known as FL Studio is a digital audio workstation (DAW) that is one of the best platforms for those who want to learn music production. People who compose audio and produce music mostly prefer FL Studio. It does not matter whether you are an advanced learner in music production or not, you can quickly learn about this as a beginner also. You have to purchase for FL Studio. However, you can try the free trial to get an overview of FL Studio.

There are many features available in FL Studio which help for recording purposes or live performance. You can record your audio to your mac or pc at very ease. It has become a powerful tool for music producers and DJs. Image-Line provides us with another crucial feature for creating professional music. It gives you a clear sound with HD sound for its 64-bit architecture. There is another feature called Delay compensation which creates a fantastic mix without overloading the CPU.

## Part 1\. Steps to Fade Audio with FL Studio

You can create and record the sound of different musical instruments like guitar, drums, and many more. Also, it gives us high-quality audio and a clear audio recording. It also does detailed audio editing. Here you can cut your audio, trim your audio, copy your audio, fade the audio, and many more. If you want to be more creative and do detailed work, you should get this software.

It can create new sounds through drum machines as a result you can show your creativity to a greater level. FL Studio also provides multiple effects for processing and transforming sound. If you want a smooth transition in increasing and decreasing the volume, then fading plays a major role in every aspect. It is a crucial skill that every musician or music producer should pursue. So, let’s discuss the steps on how to fade audio in FL:

Step1 The first and foremost task to do is the successful installation of FL Studio. Getting the latest version of this will be useful for you as it has a lot of new features.

Step2 Open your FL Studio window on your pc or mac. Then, choose the right volume parameter for the creation of automation in your FL studio. You can do it using the mixer channel method.

Step3 After getting the volume parameter, now you will need to create automation. For this, you will have to click right in the volume layer and then tap on ‘Create Automation Clip’.

After selecting that, there will be an addition of a new automation clip to the playlist.

Step4 Due to the automation clip, you will be able to do a smooth transition in and out of that song or audio. Now, you can create a suitable volume for fading your sound. If you want to create another new automation, then click on the right. After that click on the left and drag it.

## Part 2\. FL Studio Alternative to Fade Audio
