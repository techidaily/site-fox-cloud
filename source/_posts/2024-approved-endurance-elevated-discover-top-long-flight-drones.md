Avid drone owners have had the same chief complaint for years: Drones have low battery life.

It makes sense that this would be a major complaint for those looking to make the most of their drones. After all, a longer flight life means the longer you have to make sure you get your perfect shot (video or still frame,) or are able to more thoroughly inspect whatever it is you are looking to inspect. Basically, at the end of the day a longer flight time directly relates to having more fun.

While it is true that you can (and should) carry some [extra batteries](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with you while piloting your drone, stopping what you are doing to change batteries out can be a real hassle, and a drain on your productivity. That is why drone enthusiasts need to make sure they check out these drones because of their long flight time.
