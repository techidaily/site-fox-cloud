If you do not fancy 3D texts and you want a simple but effective intro video, this can suit you perfectly. The text has a 2D texture and the animations are very basic. However, it manages to create an impact in the eyes of the beholders.

There are several dynamic geometric shapes available that enhance the animations and effects on the texts. The text performs twists and turns along with shakes with the beats. The background color is black and hence, the focus is on the text and its surrounding visible objects.

### 7\. Blue and Rainy Intro Template

The base theme of the template is blue and the background is cloudy and rainy. But there is a host of animations and effects put together. There is a touch of black and white and a colourful effect. You can accommodate your logo and title together.

The template shows characters one by one and joins them to form the title. The background and the text are both 3D in texture. The template also has a 2D version that you can use on your video if you are tired of 3D texts and titles.

### 8\. 3D Cool Gold Intro

There is a craze for gold effects in texts and titles. This is another 3D text-based template but the text effect truly stands out. It is definitely a majestic effect that is a treat to the eyes. Thereafter, there are spins of the entire title as well as the individual characters.

The overall frame animation adds to the animation immensely. The background is dark but colorful that matches well with the text effect. This is enhancing the overall text effect thanks to the dynamic movement of the elements.

### 9\. Free Storm Intro Template

There are certain intro templates you must have in your collection. The lightning and storm effect is one of the most demanding intro templates. The overall effect is somewhat dark but that is what you expect in a stormy environment.

The characters of the titles have the stone texture in 3D mode. They have their individual spinning animation. The lightning effect on the title along with the stormy background is truly impactful. All you need to do is to set appropriate background music to enhance the animation.

### 10\. Blue Intro

If you prefer an outer space dynamic background with titles floating, this is exactly the same. The title floats in outer space in slow motion. Thereafter, it creates an impactful transition from slow to sudden shock motion. All the while the background has shooting stars that adds to the overall animation.

The title is in 3D texture. A graphical object in the shape of the planetary ring has been used for enhancing the effect. Along with those, there is the light dispersion and blurry effect that makes the text stand out.
