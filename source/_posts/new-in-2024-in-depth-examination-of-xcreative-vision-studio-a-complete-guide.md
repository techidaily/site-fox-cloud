**X Video Editor app** is an Android-exclusive app that has the ability to create more spectacular and captivating videos. The app has an easy-to-use and simple interface and comes with all the major video editing tools, such as effects, filters, and themes.

X is sometimes called an all-in-one movie editing app due to its wide range of features. The app has many features, like being able to play multiple videos at the same time and convert videos into other audio (FLX, WMA, ASF) and video (VOB, AVI, FLV) formats.

Another exciting feature of the X app is its built-in music library, which lets you choose from a wide range of music to add to your video. You can also add your own music, photos, and effects to personalize your video.

**Separate Audio from Video:** The app offers a unique feature that lets you separate audio content from your video and convert it into mp3, FLC, WMA, and ASF formats.

**Layers:** With the app, you can work on your project in different layers, such as images, video, overlays, and effects. If you want to redo or undo some improvements, it's easy to go back and track your edits.

**Pimp:** You can add text, transitions, effects, and filters to your videos, which is great for making different clips like tutorials, FAQs, or comical videos. This convenience allows you to be creative and produce different content your viewers will love.
