## Part 4 For More Interest: Add & Edit Your Music In Photo

While these websites simplify the task of adding music to your photographs, it might not be enough. If you're looking to do more with your project than add music in photo online, then we can help.

You can make the image clips more satisfying with the help of video editors. They can help you adjust the length of the music, the sequence of the image. Some even have unique features that can enhance image quality. So, if you would like to use such a video editor, you should opt for Wondershare Filmora.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can help you add music to photo. You can also tap into the library of several kinds of music. They're also copyright-free music. Some features are applicable not just for audio but also the video you're hoping to create with the sequences of images and music.
