In addition to conventional watermarking options, uMark also lets you watermark your photos with QR codes or different shapes.

The Arclab Watermark Studio is equipped with image resizing tools which makes it a perfect choice for photographers who often post their work on social media.

#### 4. [TSR Watermark Image](https://www.watermark-image.com/)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

The images that were taken with Canon, Sony, Nikon, and numerous other cameras can also be watermarked through metadata. The TSR Watermark Image app provides a rich selection of special effects, borders, and crosses that let you create stylish watermarks. The free version of this photo watermarking software offers only a limited amount of options and if you want to gain access to more than 200 fonts or advanced uploading features you must purchase one of the available subscription plans.

#### 5. [Mass Watermark](https://www.masswatermark.com/)

**Price:** Free trial available, $30 for a lifetime license

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

**Price:** Free trial available, $24.90 for a lifetime license

**Compatibility:** Windows

In fact, you can watermark all your photos with Watermark Software in just three easy steps, since you just have to import the images to which you want to add a watermark, insert text or picture you’d like to use as a watermark and wait for the app to process them. The Watermark Tiling feature makes unauthorized usage of your work even more difficult, while the EXIF editor enables you to add watermarks to a photo’s metadata. The free version of the app offers only a limited number of features, and you must purchase the lifetime license if want to use all the watermarking tools this app has to offer.

#### 7. [Alamoon Watermark](https://alamoon.com/watermark-editor.html)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

Despite being slightly outdated, Alamoon Watermark software is still a reliable option for all photographers who are looking for a simple way to add watermarks to their photos. This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes. However, it lacks advanced watermarking and photo editing tools, so enhancing the colors in a photo or creating watermark templates is not possible with Alamoon Watermark app. The professional version of this watermarking software is largely overpriced and there are more powerful and more affordable options available.

#### 8. [Star Watermark](https://www.star-watermark.com/)

**Price:** Free version available, pricing plans start at $17 for a lifetime license

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Customizing each watermark you create with this cross-platform app is a straightforward process that won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can easily alter the size of the text, change its color, add shadows or position the text anywhere in the photo. Star Watermark enables its users to use images as watermarks or even create multilayered watermarks. The batch processing features, however, remain one of the most common reasons why professional photographers opt to use the Star Watermark software. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any of the advanced watermarking features, and it doesn’t allow you to use your digital signature as a watermark.

#### 9. [Visual Watermark](https://www.visualwatermark.com/)

**Price:** Free trial available, pricing plans start at $19.95 for a lifetime license

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, Android

The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy.

There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.

#### 10. [Water Marquee](https://www.watermarquee.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images. The process of adding a watermark to a photo with Water Marquee is remarkably simple, as you just have to upload a photo to the platform and click on the Add Text, Add Logo or Use Template option. You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background. When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.

**Conclusion**

There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?
