<!-- affiliate ads end -->
iDrive is another superb **Adobe storage** alternative advertised as an online backup service compared to cloud storage because its goal is to keep your information secure rather than make it accessible and shareable. Despite this, it still supports strong syncing, and some of the collaboration features that cloud storage providers provide. Like Dropbox, it employs quick block-level synchronization to continuously sync all of your files across an infinite number of devices, including network drives. Additionally, it maintains up to 30 earlier versions of each file indefinitely, letting you access older work if necessary.

**Features**

* Easily backup up a physical drive
* Encryption from end to end
* Provides different options for transferring files
* Easily sync folders

### 4\. Do you need an internet connection to use Adobe Creative Cloud desktop app?

No. However, your computer must have the software to use the desktop apps in **Adobe Creative Cloud storage**, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Consequently, you can utilize them without a constant Internet connection.

### 5\. Can I put my Adobe application on a different computer?

You can install your **Adobe cloud storage** software on multiple computers and sign in (activate) on two of them but use it on only one device at a time with your license.

## Conclusion

In short, cloud storage is an online safe place to store and share files remotely. With **Adobe cloud storage,** one can easily achieve a good workflow between team members and remote workers. This exceptional **Adobe cloud storage pricing** is affordable and gives users access to 100GB of storage space with support for up to 20 creative apps. Besides, you can try out any of the alternatives listed, like Wondershare Drive, as a cheaper but the best alternative.
