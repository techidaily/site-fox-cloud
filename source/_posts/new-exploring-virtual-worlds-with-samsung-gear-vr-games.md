## Spirit Journey

 If you are not fond of violating or shooting games and want a peaceful and soothing experience while playing, then Spirit Journey is just the right choice for you.

## Motivator

 This is another very exciting shooting game plotted in the year 2044\. During this time people tend to lose their spirit because of an unknown virus attack named lethargy. The virus soon goes out of control and in such a situation the International Disease Research Center creates a nanomachine that can attack the virus at its source.
