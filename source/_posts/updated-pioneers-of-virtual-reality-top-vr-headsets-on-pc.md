### [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/)

Comparing to HTC Vive having its room-scale technology along with two of the included motion controllers [Oculus Rift](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) still considered to be the matching VR experience. Traditional game controllers are very much limited to a static virtual reality experience as compared to the Rift. Proper hand tracking is required to enjoy the immerse feel of the Rift.

### [Microsoft HoloLens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This device merges augmented and virtual reality and in turn considered as one of the most ruthless development ever planned by the developers. It blends real world elements with the augmented holographic metaphors, so that you can walk on other planets while walking in your living room. Handset is also provided with a full window 10 system inside it. It is now available for the windows insider affiliates.

### [Razer OSVR HDK 2](https://www.razerzone.com/hdk2-promo)

### [META 2](https://www.metavision.com/)

Meta was released in 2013 for augmented reality but now Meta 2 is the real invention that has caught eyes on. It looks like a replica of HoloLens, a largely shaped design like a helmet.

### Sulon Q VR Headset

This device was released in San Francisco during GDC 2016\. It is considered to be a competitor of HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. It is compatible with the PC on windows 10\.
