You will feel little annoying to know that its battery takes about 2 hours to get completely charged. So you have to wait so long to make it fly again.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

This drone is designed with five unique modes for flight; one of these is the journey mode that helps to take of automatically and then starts taking selfie.

#### 6\.  Controller

![yuneec typhoon h controller](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yuneec-typhoon-h-controller.jpg)

 The controller part is really interesting with few additional features as compared to its predecessors.

Here is good news for professionals; it is possible to connect this drone to more than one controller at a time so that few highly customized shoots can be gathered. Filmmakers love to access these advanced features.

#### 7\.  Camera
