The video compression level can be also adjusted with ease by choosing high bit rates or normal mode.

 It is possible to record footage with Ghost S in high bit rate as well as in normal mode. The still quality is 12MP that offers crystal clear views. When you use normal bit rate at 1080p then edges of videos appear jagged and interlaced. But this issue can be slightly resolved with high bit rate settings.

 This camera consists of a Micro SDXC type card slot that can easily support cards up to 64 GB capacities. Other than this, your camera possesses Mini-HDMI ports, Mini-USB ports and a large size battery that can support long hour recording. With this big size battery you can easily record up to 3.5 hours with 1080p settings at 30fps frame rate.

#### **The Bottom Line:**
