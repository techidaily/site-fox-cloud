In Snapchat, **the process of how do you speed up a video on Snapchat** depends on the filters available. The Speed Modifier filter options have high-quality speed-changing functions, including the Speed Up option.

**A step-by-step breakdown of how to speed up Snapchat videos:**

Step1 Download the Snapchat app and launch it on your iPhone or Android smartphone. Sign into the app using your credentials.

Step2 Tap and hold your finger on the Capture button. This will record the video. Keep your hold on the button until the recording is complete, and then release it.
