 Professionals videographers always need to improve stability in their footage and that is why manufacturers have launched so many designs of handheld 3 axis type gimbals into market within last few years. The device has brought a new revolution to the world of videographers with highly smooth and well stabilized shots. Now, you need not to mess with that old bulky steadicam system because the advanced gimbal stabilizers can handle everything with ease.

 If you are a videographer or planning to switch to this career then you may need some guidance for selection of best gimbal product. As market is loaded with so many designs, it becomes quite difficult to make final decision about which one will suit to particular needs. Those who are in this stage of confusion may find this article useful because it contains details about top 10 3-Axis Gimbal stabilizers that work perfectly with Mirrorless cameras and DSLRs.

## About Gimbal Stabilizer

### Section 1: What is Gimbal Stabilizer?

 Recently, gimbals have made an impressive entry to the world of videography and today they have become an essential accessory for professionals. A Gimbal is usually designed with 3 brushless motors and they help operators to move their camera easily on all axis. There is an inertial measurement unit that works with all motors separately to improve camera stabilization.

### Section 2: 2 Axis or 3 Axis Gimbal?

 You will generally find two types of gimbals in market: 2-axis and 3-axis. Selection for anyone of these totally depends upon your application. The 2 axis type gimbals have more control over pitch and yaw movements but the 3 axis gimbals extend control to roll movements too along with yaw and pitch adjustments.

 Generally, the 3 axis gimbals are preferred for aerial applications in drones and RC helicopters. They also find applications in applications where camera is to be attached on a car suction mount, camera jib or any remote controlled vehicle. 3 axis gimbals have higher control on camera stabilization.
