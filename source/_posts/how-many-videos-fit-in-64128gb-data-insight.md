A 64GB storage device can hold more than 1 hour and 37 minutes of video at a resolution of 2.7k at 120fps. On a 64GB memory card, recording at a resolution of 1080p at 60fps allows for around 5 hours of video time.

### 2\. Veed.io

![64gb-128gb-hold-video-size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/64gb-128gb-hold-video-size-7.jpg)

Compatibility: Online

If you don't want to install or use an app on your computer, many websites will allow you to submit a video file and compress it for you. Some of these services demand registration, others charge a monthly fee (or place a watermark on your movie), and others are free and only require a video file.

VEED.IO is the first service we'll look at. VEED provides a simple video compression tool for free as part of its video editing tools. It works on both Windows and Mac, and it runs entirely within your browser, so no software is required.

**Step 1: Import file:**

Open the web browser and open the veed.io video compressor. Import the video file by clicking on 'Upload a file.'

**Step 2: Compress the file.**

Once your video file is uploaded, you will see the file compressing options on the screen. You can compress the file to the size that you want.

It is to note that the video file size can be reduced to half depending on the length and quality of the video.

**Step 3: Compress and export the file.**

Click on 'Compress file' and wait until the video file is compressed to your preferred size. You can export the file by sharing the video link or downloading the video on your device.

![64gb-128gb-hold-video-size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/64gb-128gb-hold-video-size-11.jpg)

Note: The compression time might vary depending on the quality and size of the file. Also, you might have to compromise on video quality to compress the video file using veed.io.

### 3\. Video Compressor

Compatibility: Android

Last but not least, the Fast Video Compressor can compress both videos and photos. This tool compresses low, normal, or high-quality files in batches. You can compress a folder or a single file. Aside from that, this tool allows you to trim videos, extract MP3 files from them, and share them. Furthermore, its user interface is simple and basic.

**Step 1: Download the app.**

Open the Google Play Store on Android, download the video compressor, and install it.
