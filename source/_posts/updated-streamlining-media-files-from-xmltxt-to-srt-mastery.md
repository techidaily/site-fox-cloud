### 1\. SRT

It is a plain text file that is composed of three sections, Script Info, Styles, and Events.

Step1 First of all, go to the [GoTranscript Subtitle Converter](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter).

Step2 Now click on the “Upload” option and select the XML subtitle from your device.
