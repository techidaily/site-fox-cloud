The outer edge possesses a highly flexible yet durable plastic guard cage.

#### 3\.  Battery Life

 The average recorded flight time of this unit is about 6 to 10 minutes that is powered from 500mAh batteries with 3.7Volt rating. This high quality battery can hold charge perfectly but you need to spend about 100 minutes for recharging of drone batteries.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

 This device possesses regular flight mode as default mode so users need not to make much efforts for its flight arrangements.

#### 6\.  Camera

![syma x5c camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/syma-x5c-camera.jpg)

 Syma H5C camera is rated as moderately stable and it is capable enough to take impressive pictures from air. This device is equipped with a 2GB MicroSD card that offers personal storage space to all recorded videos and images.

But Syma H5C is really a good choice to start with.
