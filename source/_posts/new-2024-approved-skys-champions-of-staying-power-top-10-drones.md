Avid drone owners have had the same chief complaint for years: Drones have low battery life.

It makes sense that this would be a major complaint for those looking to make the most of their drones. After all, a longer flight life means the longer you have to make sure you get your perfect shot (video or still frame,) or are able to more thoroughly inspect whatever it is you are looking to inspect. Basically, at the end of the day a longer flight time directly relates to having more fun.

While it is true that you can (and should) carry some [extra batteries](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with you while piloting your drone, stopping what you are doing to change batteries out can be a real hassle, and a drain on your productivity. That is why drone enthusiasts need to make sure they check out these drones because of their long flight time.

The camera on this drone has been developed and redesigned from other models to ensure that you are able to produce images with the lowest possible image distortion. The Yuneec Q500+ also has a Follow Me feature that allows the drone to follow you, adjusting to your location based on the transmitter. The footage you are shooting with the drone can be displayed on the Yuneec Q500+'s five inch touchscreen personal ground station in order to make sure you can frame up your shot perfectly. With about 22 min. of flight time, you will be sure to get your perfect shot. The Yuneec Q500+ has a 2,000m control range, and sells for $799.
