With power-packed features like 3D camera functionality, A11 Bionic processor, 5.8-inch OLED display, and the very special feature Face id where you can unlock the iPhone X by just looking at it made this device a true joy for the users. But for a while, it is being heard that the Face ID is failing whenever you try setting up, and the problem has increased post the iOS 11.2 update. What are the reasons for the failure of face id?

* Since 48hours if you haven't unlocked the iPhone X

* If the remote command is received by you on your iPhone X
* If your face doesn't match five times
* Once you power off or click emergency SOS by holding and pressing the volume control and side button instantaneously for 2 seconds
* If you iPhone X charge is 10% or below
