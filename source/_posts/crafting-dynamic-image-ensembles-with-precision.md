## What is a photomontage?

Unlike the typical photograph with a single pic, a photomontage encompasses several photos collaged together. It doesn’t matter the number of photos it contains. You can also use a variety of locations to take photos. Way back, photographers composed photo montage images by cutting, gluing, and arranging pieces together. However, the advent of computers has shifted the dimension of making a photo montage. Several apps are available for not only montaging your photos, but also editing them for a splendid outcome.

### i) What’s your subject?

Ask yourself what you intend to express with your photomontage. Pick a subject that’s static and simple. You should also consider the ease of adding more photos if you need to. Plan out how many photos you want to include in your montage as well.

### ii) Keep it real

Don’t exaggerate your work, but keep it real. At a glance, related collage photos will make sense. Likewise, check the photos you are importing into your editing program. It’s great to use easily editable clips.

### iii) Be adventurous

Making a photomontage need not be plain. Go out of your way and add some creativity as well. Have in mind what you want to create in advance to avoid distractions. However, add all the necessary elements and just let it be fun.

### iv) Take more than needed

Have more backup photos than you need. This gives you ways to twist your arrangement where necessary. It is also a perfect way to try several suits and find the right match for your college.

## Fantastic Photomontage Examples

Photomontage art is highly-valued due to its uniqueness in telling a story or combining memories into one piece. Since its inception, many artists prefer it over other modes of painting. Here is a list of photo montage examples from great artists of-all-time.

### #1.Oscar Rejlander: The Two Ways of Life

He is among the pioneering art photographers who excelled in photomontage. Besides working on waxed-paper processes and wet-collodion, Oscar created perfect erotic artworks with several groups, like street children and circus models. "The Two Ways of Life" was his infamous print that consisted of thirty-two photos. The theme is about the choice between virtue and vice. It represented two young men being offered guidance by a patriarch, moving from the countryside into the stage of life. It was a success and earned the "Royal Photographic Society of London" recognition.

### #4\. Hannah Hoch–Cut with the Kitchen Knife

She identifies with the Dada movement in Germany. This piece of art reflects Hannah’s views on the social and political issues that occurred during World War I.
