## What to Consider When Buying a FPV Goggle?

**Form:** There are two major categories of FPV goggles, compact and box. With compact goggles you will be getting a lightweight goggle that should fit snuggles to your head and give you two small screens. While with the Box goggles you will have a large LCD screen (allowing for a better view,) however, they tend to be a little more heavy than the compact FPV goggles.

**Aspect Ratio:** Your drone's FPV camera come in one of two aspect ratios - 16:9 or 4:3\. This means it is absolutely crucial to make sure that you grab a paid of FPV goggles that match that aspect ratio. If you mix and match aspect ratios yo will end up with an image that is squashed or stretched out. While you may think you could get used to the skewed view, it takes away from the precision (and point) of having a FPV goggle when drone racing.

**Field of View:** Each set of FPV goggles comes with their own Field of View (FOV.) This means each pair of goggles has its own degree to which the edge of the viewing screen is angled from your eyes. The higher the FOV a goggle has the better your picture quality will be.

**Head Tracking:** When it comes to drone racing, you will want to make sure you have a FPV goggle that has a high head tracking ratio. Head tracking allows for a truly immersive experience because it relates to the ability of your on-board camera motion to bind with your head motion (meaning the camera moves smoothly and accurately in relation to how you move your head as the pilot.)
