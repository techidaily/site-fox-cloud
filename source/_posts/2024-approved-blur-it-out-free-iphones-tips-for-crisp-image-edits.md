## Blur It Out: Free iPhones Tips for Crisp Image Edits

There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones.

You can learn how to do this by following the steps given below:

**Step 1: Get to the Camera App**
