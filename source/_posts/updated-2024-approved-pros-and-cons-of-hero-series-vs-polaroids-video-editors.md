 Polaroid Cube+ is developed with much simpler design as compared to GoPro. You can control photos as well as videos from a single button on the top - press it one time to capture stills and twice to record videos. One more button is available for Wi-Fi control that also assists in making connection with Cube+ application. You will find a Micro-USB slot and MicroSD card slot behind the door.
