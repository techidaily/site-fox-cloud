A time-lapse video is generally a long video captured by speeding up the time to make it a shorter video. In other words, these videos’ frames are captured at a much lower rate than normal and when the video is played, it seems to be playing faster. For instance, you might have watched many videos where the clouds are running too fast or the sunset process is happening quickly or maybe traffic is pacing up too much. All these kind of videos use time-lapse technology.

Many Android devices including Samsung (latest) or Huawei enable users to record **time-lapse videos** effortlessly. This article will help you learn how you can take and convert time lapse video on Android smoothly so that you get lots of appreciation and likes when you share with the friends.

The main camera app holds the feature and you can create stunning hyper lapse on Android device yourself.

## Part2: Notes you should know

When you have decided to shoot a time-lapse video, here are some important things you should take notice of. Let’s get them what.

* First of all, please bear in mind that a time-lapse or hyper-lapse videos demand ample amount of hours. Therefore, you should be prepared for that and it is recommended to make use of a tripod. This will eliminate your need of standing the whole time and will make the video stable and fixed. Putting differently, using a tripod will prevent your videobeing shaky and there is no need for you to stand and record the video. Your time and energy will be saved as a bonus.
* When you are shooting time lapse video of moving clouds for 3-15 seconds playback time, 3-4 hours is the recommended recording time for it.
* If shooting busy streets is your priority, it can be done between 3-20 seconds for 4-5 hours period.
* For shooting flowers blossom time or rotting fruit, it is recommended to keep the Airplane Mode on since the process is relatively long and any call between the shoot could hamper the video.
* Lastly, please ensure to have sufficient space in your SD card, 1GB at Also, for a time-lapse video, your device should be charged fully.

## Part4: Differences between Hyper Lapse and Time Lapse

You have learnt almost everything about time-lapse videography. We also think you should know how hyper-lapse and time-lapse distinguishes from each other. These two techniques are not same. The technique of hyper-lapse video includes a moving camera in contrast with the time-lapse videos. It is part of time-lapse videography where the camera is moving at different angles and exposures. Keeping it simpler, a time-lapse video is made with keeping camera undisturbed whereas hyper-lapse videos involverecording the video while moving the camera.

## Final Verdict

Now you have mastered everything about time-lapse videos and time lapse apps on Android. We are positive that you got useful information from this post. Nevertheless, we would like to advise you to go for the converting process on desktop. This will help in giving better and quality results because using a phone for the process can be complicated and become uneasy to operate. If you make up your mind on using desktop, Filmora is the most recommended product to use which will help in creating remarkable time-lapse videos.
