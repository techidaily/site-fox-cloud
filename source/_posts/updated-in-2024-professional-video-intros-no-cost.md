## Professional Video Intros, No Cost

Video intros are important in videography because viewers first see a video intro before the main video. You may lose viewers if the video intro is not attractive enough to make them stay on your page or YouTube channel. Almost everyone needs visual content, especially a business owner or YouTuber. Learning about the two main categories of **video intro makers** gives you total control of your visual contents, irrespective of your need for the software. For example, you will learn about the uniqueness of editable and not editable free **video intro templates**. Read on and figure out how you may use individual video intro makers.

## Part 1: Free video intro templates (Editable)

All the individual video intro templates are free to use but offer significant features that differentiate them from one another. Learning about these features and using them in your projects enhance productivity and utility. Then we will introduce some customizable video intro templates, which users can change according to their style and creativity to show their personality better. Some editable video intro makers need software for editing; others are free without a corresponding editor, and you can edit it online. Some essential intro makers include:

### 1\. **Filmstock**

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the editor for Filmstock. Filmstock allows users to edit audio using the audio equalizer, which balances the sound frequency and signal. Filmstock makes vocals more articulate because of the in-built enhanced frequency range. The video intro maker is suitable for music videos or adverts, especially videos that need heavy bass.

Filmstock supports GIF – aside from the video compilation, you can exploit the GIF support since it includes a 4K resolution editing option. The GIF, video stabilization, and 4K resolution make Filmstock stand out in the competition. Other significant features include split-screen, multiple video clips, color grading, and video controls.

### 2\. Canva

Canva allows you to build from starch or add templates to your video. Canva support image combination for stylish pictures and audio combo. Canva image filter manipulates the pictures or video output: you can change the background or give it another entirely different look through the filter.

The video merge also supports video and picture cropping: circle crop and mirror images. Canva allows video merging: you can do this by using your original visual content with the template on Canva.

### 3. Flexclip

Flexclip is suitable for small and large businesses because it is easy to use with free titled templates. All the templates are editable; they have outstanding features like video merge, picture overlay, and HD resolution. Flexclip is important for intro video since it permits easy video compilation.

## Part 2: Free video intro templates download (Not editable)

Unlike editable free templates, these video intro templates are ready-made. You can download and use the templates, but they are not editable. Selecting editable or not editable templates depends on your needs and experience.
